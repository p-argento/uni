I will paste here the most relevant answers I got from ChatGPT.
I will use this document as a reference for the crucial aspects that must be clear.
The final goal is to have a cheatsheet on paper (or latex).
ChatGPT is so good I think I will use it to produce a book for the course from the slides.

# PD vs PSD vs SPD Matrix

Yes! Let's go step by step through the properties of QQ in quadratic programming (QP) and their implications for optimization algorithms.

---

## **1. Positive Semi-Definiteness (PSD) and Eigenvalues**

A matrix QQ is **positive semi-definite (PSD)** if:

xTQx≥0∀x∈Rn.x^T Q x \geq 0 \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n.

- This is **equivalent** to saying that **all eigenvalues of QQ are non-negative**, i.e., λi≥0∀i.\lambda_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i.
- If QQ is also **positive definite (PD)** (i.e., xTQx>0x^T Q x > 0 for all x≠0x \neq 0), then **all eigenvalues are strictly positive** (λi>0)(\lambda_i > 0).

---

## **2. Invertibility and Full Rank**

- **Is QQ always invertible?**
    
    - **No!** A matrix is invertible if and only if it is **nonsingular**, meaning it has **full rank**.
    - If QQ is only **PSD** (not PD), it might have **some zero eigenvalues**, making it **singular** (not invertible).
- **Is QQ always full-rank?**
    
    - **No, not necessarily.**
    - QQ is **full-rank** (i.e., rank(Q)=n\text{rank}(Q) = n) if and only if it is **positive definite (PD)**.
    - If QQ is only **PSD**, it might be rank-deficient (i.e., some eigenvalues are 0, so its rank is <n< n).

### **Summary of Properties**

|QQ type|Eigenvalues λi\lambda_i|Invertible?|Full Rank?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)|λi≥0\lambda_i \geq 0|**Only if no zero eigenvalues**|**Only if no zero eigenvalues**|
|Positive Definite (PD)|λi>0\lambda_i > 0|**Always**|**Always**|

---

## **3. Implications for QP and Optimization Algorithms**

### **(a) When QQ is Positive Definite (PD)**

- The objective function is **strictly convex**, meaning there is a **unique global minimum**.
- Methods like **Newton’s method, interior-point methods, and gradient-based algorithms** work efficiently because the Hessian (QQ) is always invertible.

### **(b) When QQ is Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)**

- The problem is still **convex**, but the minimum **might not be unique** (if QQ has zero eigenvalues, meaning some directions in the space are "flat").
- **Optimization algorithms may need special handling**, such as:
    - Using **regularization** (adding a small multiple of the identity, Q+ϵIQ + \epsilon I, to make QQ invertible).
    - Using **methods that handle rank-deficient Hessians**, such as **conjugate gradient methods**.

### **(c) When QQ is Indefinite (Not PSD)**

- The problem is **non-convex**, meaning there might be **local minima and saddle points**.
- Many convex optimization methods (like interior-point or gradient descent) **do not work well** without modifications.
- Special methods like **trust-region methods** or **global optimization techniques** are needed.

---

## **4. Key Takeaways for QP Algorithms**

- **Convex QP problems (where QQ is PSD)** can be solved efficiently using:
    
    - **Interior-point methods**
    - **Active-set methods**
    - **Gradient-based methods**
- If QQ is **rank-deficient (some zero eigenvalues)**:
    
    - The solution **may not be unique**.
    - Algorithms like **Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse** or **regularization** techniques can help.
- If QQ is **indefinite (not PSD)**:
    
    - The problem is **non-convex**.
    - Need **global optimization** techniques (e.g., branch-and-bound, trust-region methods).

Would you like me to expand on a specific QP algorithm or clarify anything further? 🚀

Yes, **SPD** stands for **Symmetric Positive Definite**. It's indeed **different** from **PSD**, which stands for **Positive Semi-Definite**. Here's the distinction:

### **1. Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)**

- **Symmetric**: The matrix is equal to its transpose, i.e., A=ATA = A^T.
- **Positive Definite (PD)**: All the **eigenvalues** of the matrix are **positive** (λi>0\lambda_i > 0 for all ii).
    - This means that for any non-zero vector xx, xTAx>0x^T A x > 0.
- **SPD matrices** are a special case of symmetric matrices where the eigenvalues are strictly positive.

### **2. Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)**

- **Symmetric**: Like SPD, the matrix is equal to its transpose (A=ATA = A^T).
- **Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)**: The eigenvalues of the matrix are **non-negative** (λi≥0\lambda_i \geq 0 for all ii).
    - This means that for any non-zero vector xx, xTAx≥0x^T A x \geq 0, but it's allowed for some eigenvalues to be zero.

### **Key Differences**:

- **SPD**: All eigenvalues are **strictly positive** (i.e., greater than 0).
- **PSD**: Eigenvalues are **non-negative** (i.e., greater than or equal to 0), meaning that some eigenvalues can be zero.

### Why Conjugate Gradient (CG) Works Well for SPD Matrices:

- The **Conjugate Gradient (CG)** method is most effective when the matrix QQ is **Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)** because:
    - SPD matrices have **unique solutions** and guarantee **positive eigenvalues**, ensuring that the solution process won't get stuck or experience instability.
    - The method is **guaranteed to converge** in at most nn iterations, where nn is the dimension of the matrix, when used with SPD matrices.

For **Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)** matrices, the CG method can still work, but:

- The matrix might have **zero eigenvalues**, and the system might not have a unique solution (or it might have infinitely many solutions), so special care is needed.

In optimization problems like Quadratic Programming (QP), having **SPD matrices** guarantees that the problem is well-posed and stable for algorithms like CG.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into how SPD and PSD matrices affect optimization methods!






# Well-conditioned vs ill-conditioned

You're welcome! Now let's dive into **matrix conditioning** and its impact on choosing optimization algorithms.

---

## **1. What is Conditioning?**

The **conditioning of a matrix** refers to how sensitive its solutions are to small perturbations in input data. It is measured by the **condition number**:

κ(Q)=λmax⁡λmin⁡\kappa(Q) = \frac{\lambda_{\max}}{\lambda_{\min}}

where λmax⁡\lambda_{\max} and λmin⁡\lambda_{\min} are the largest and smallest nonzero eigenvalues of QQ.

- **Well-conditioned matrix**: κ(Q)≈1\kappa(Q) \approx 1 (low condition number).
- **Ill-conditioned matrix**: κ(Q)≫1\kappa(Q) \gg 1 (high condition number).

A high condition number means small errors in data or computations **cause large changes in the solution**.

---

## **2. Impact of Conditioning on Optimization Algorithms**

|Conditioning|Properties|Algorithm Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|**Well-conditioned** (κ(Q)≈1)(\kappa(Q) \approx 1)|Eigenvalues are close in magnitude → stable computations|**Direct methods** (e.g., Cholesky, Newton's method) work well|
|**Moderately ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)(\kappa(Q) somewhat large)|Some eigenvalues are small → solution may have some numerical instability|**Preconditioned iterative methods** (e.g., Conjugate Gradient with preconditioning) can improve efficiency|
|**Highly ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)≫1)(\kappa(Q) \gg 1)|Eigenvalues vary drastically → severe instability|**Regularization techniques** (Tikhonov, adding ϵI\epsilon I), **iterative methods** (Conjugate Gradient, Gradient Descent)|

---

## **3. When to Use Different Algorithms Based on Conditioning**

### **(a) Direct Methods (Good for Well-Conditioned Problems)**

1. **Cholesky Decomposition** (only for **positive definite QQ**)
    
    - Factorizes Q=LLTQ = LL^T, where LL is a lower triangular matrix.
    - **Fast** and numerically stable for well-conditioned problems.
    - Used in **interior-point methods** for convex QPs.
2. **LU / QR Decomposition**
    
    - Works for general matrices (not just PD).
    - More robust than Cholesky for near-singular matrices but still struggles with ill-conditioned problems.
3. **Newton’s Method**
    
    - Uses the Hessian QQ directly in updates.
    - Fast for **small, well-conditioned problems**.
    - If QQ is ill-conditioned, Newton's steps may be unstable.

---

### **(b) Iterative Methods (Better for Ill-Conditioned Problems)**

1. **Gradient Descent (GD)**
    
    - Converges **slowly** when QQ is ill-conditioned because it moves faster in well-conditioned directions and slower in ill-conditioned ones.
    - The convergence rate depends on κ(Q)\kappa(Q), roughly O(κ(Q))O(\kappa(Q)).
2. **Conjugate Gradient (CG) (Best for SPD Matrices)**
    
    - Faster than GD, especially for large, sparse problems.
    - Converges in at most nn iterations, but in practice much faster.
    - **Preconditioning** (using P≈Q−1P \approx Q^{-1} to reduce κ(Q)\kappa(Q)) improves efficiency.
3. **Quasi-Newton Methods (e.g., BFGS, L-BFGS)**
    
    - Approximates the Hessian QQ without computing it directly.
    - More robust than Newton’s method for **ill-conditioned** problems.

---

### **(c) Regularization Techniques (Fixing Ill-Conditioned Matrices)**

When QQ is very ill-conditioned, solutions are unstable. Some common fixes:

1. **Tikhonov Regularization** (a.k.a. Ridge Regression)
    
    - Modify QQ to Q+λIQ + \lambda I, where λ>0\lambda > 0 is small.
    - This increases the smallest eigenvalue, reducing κ(Q)\kappa(Q).
    - Used in **machine learning** and **numerical optimization**.
2. **Damped Newton’s Method**
    
    - Instead of using QQ directly, update using a modified step size to prevent large jumps.
3. **Preconditioning**
    
    - Replace QQ with P−1QP^{-1}Q, where PP is an approximation of QQ.
    - Reduces κ(Q)\kappa(Q), improving convergence of CG and GD.

## **4. Summary: How to Choose an Algorithm Based on Conditioning**

|**Conditioning**|**Preferred Algorithm**|**Techniques to Improve Convergence**|
|---|---|---|
|**Well-conditioned** (κ(Q)≈1)(\kappa(Q) \approx 1)|**Cholesky, Newton’s method, Conjugate Gradient**|No special modifications needed|
|**Moderately ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)≫1)(\kappa(Q) \gg 1)|**Preconditioned CG, BFGS, Regularized Newton**|Preconditioning, regularization (Q+λIQ + \lambda I)|
|**Highly ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)≫106)(\kappa(Q) \gg 10^6)|**Gradient Descent (slow), Regularized CG or Quasi-Newton methods**|Strong preconditioning, Tikhonov regularization|

---

## **5. Final Takeaways**

- **Well-conditioned problems** allow efficient direct methods (Cholesky, Newton, CG).
- **Ill-conditioned problems** need iterative methods (CG, BFGS) with **preconditioning or regularization**.
- **Highly ill-conditioned problems** require extreme modifications, like **damped updates or regularization techniques**.

When we say "this is big" or "this is small" in the context of optimization (or numerical analysis in general), we are often referring to the **relative scale of numbers** in relation to **machine precision** and the **floating-point representation** used in the computer.

### Key Points:

1. **Floating-Point Representation**:
    
    - In computers, numbers are represented using **floating-point arithmetic**, which can introduce small errors due to limited precision.
    - Most modern computers use **64-bit double-precision** floating-point numbers (IEEE 754 standard). These have a **machine epsilon** ϵ\epsilon of approximately: ϵ≈10−16\epsilon \approx 10^{-16} This means that the smallest relative difference between two numbers that can be represented is roughly 10−1610^{-16} times the larger of the two numbers.
2. **Condition Number and Its Relation to Floating Point Precision**:
    
    - When your professor says that the condition number κ(Q)\kappa(Q) is **"big"** (e.g., κ(Q)≫106\kappa(Q) \gg 10^6), they're pointing out that the matrix QQ is **ill-conditioned**, meaning small numerical errors can significantly affect the solution.
    - A **large condition number** κ(Q)\kappa(Q) (e.g., κ(Q)>106\kappa(Q) > 10^6) means that the matrix is **very ill-conditioned**, and **small errors** in data or calculations will lead to **large errors** in the solution.

### How to Define "Big" and "Small" in Practice:

To understand when a number is considered "big" or "small," let's break it down:

1. **Small Numbers**:
    
    - **Small numbers** are typically those that are **close to the machine epsilon** ϵ≈10−16\epsilon \approx 10^{-16} in magnitude.
    - For instance, if the magnitude of a number is smaller than 10−1610^{-16}, it may not be represented accurately in the floating-point system and could be considered **too small** for reliable calculations.
2. **Big Numbers**:
    
    - **Big numbers** are those that are **much larger** than typical machine precision. If the number exceeds around **10610^6 or more**, it may be considered large in the context of optimization, especially when referring to ill-conditioning.
    - In numerical analysis, **κ(Q)\kappa(Q) around 10610^6 or larger** often indicates an ill-conditioned problem, and when numbers are much larger than the machine's precision range, they can become **unstable** in computations.
3. **Typical Ranges**:
    
    - **Condition number** κ(Q)≈101\kappa(Q) \approx 10^1 to 10310^3: These are typically **well-conditioned** problems and are stable to solve with most numerical methods.
    - **Condition number** κ(Q)≈106\kappa(Q) \approx 10^6 to 10910^9: These are **moderately ill-conditioned**, meaning algorithms might converge slower or require more iterations.
    - **Condition number** κ(Q)≫109\kappa(Q) \gg 10^9: These are **highly ill-conditioned**, where even small computational errors can lead to large errors in the solution, and special techniques like **preconditioning** or **regularization** are necessary.

### **Practical Guidelines**:

1. **Condition Number and Floating Point Precision**:
    
    - If κ(Q)\kappa(Q) is greater than 10610^6, the problem is likely **ill-conditioned** relative to the precision of the computer.
    - For numbers greater than 10910^9, **numerical instability** is a serious concern, and you may need to use **regularization** or **preconditioning**.
2. **Big vs Small Relative to Epsilon**:
    
    - If a matrix or vector element is smaller than 10−1610^{-16} in absolute value, it is considered **too small** for reliable computation (could be treated as zero).
    - If an element or condition number is significantly larger than 10610^6, it's considered **"big"**, meaning the system is potentially **ill-conditioned**.

### **When Your Professor Says "Big" or "Small"**:

- A good rule of thumb is that **numbers smaller than machine epsilon** (10−16)(10^{-16}) are **small**, and **numbers larger than 10610^6 or 10910^9** in the context of condition numbers are considered **large** (ill-conditioned).
- If your professor points to a number and says it’s **big**, they are likely referring to it being **much larger** than the typical precision (e.g., κ(Q)>106\kappa(Q) > 10^6), suggesting potential numerical instability or that the problem might be challenging for optimization algorithms.

### Summary of How to Identify "Big" and "Small":

- **Small**: Numbers below 10−1610^{-16}, or condition numbers less than 10310^3.
- **Big**: Condition numbers above 10610^6, or numbers greater than 10910^9 indicating ill-conditioning.

Does that make sense for interpreting your professor's references to big or small numbers in optimization? Would you like to dive deeper into any of these concepts?
