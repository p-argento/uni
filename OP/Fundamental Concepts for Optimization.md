I will paste here the most relevant answers I got from ChatGPT.
I will use this document as a reference for the crucial aspects that must be clear.
The final goal is to have a cheatsheet on paper (or latex).
ChatGPT is so good I think I will use it to produce a book for the course from the slides.

# PD vs PSD Matrix

Yes! Let's go step by step through the properties of QQ in quadratic programming (QP) and their implications for optimization algorithms.

---

## **1. Positive Semi-Definiteness (PSD) and Eigenvalues**

A matrix QQ is **positive semi-definite (PSD)** if:

xTQx≥0∀x∈Rn.x^T Q x \geq 0 \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n.

- This is **equivalent** to saying that **all eigenvalues of QQ are non-negative**, i.e., λi≥0∀i.\lambda_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i.
- If QQ is also **positive definite (PD)** (i.e., xTQx>0x^T Q x > 0 for all x≠0x \neq 0), then **all eigenvalues are strictly positive** (λi>0)(\lambda_i > 0).

---

## **2. Invertibility and Full Rank**

- **Is QQ always invertible?**
    
    - **No!** A matrix is invertible if and only if it is **nonsingular**, meaning it has **full rank**.
    - If QQ is only **PSD** (not PD), it might have **some zero eigenvalues**, making it **singular** (not invertible).
- **Is QQ always full-rank?**
    
    - **No, not necessarily.**
    - QQ is **full-rank** (i.e., rank(Q)=n\text{rank}(Q) = n) if and only if it is **positive definite (PD)**.
    - If QQ is only **PSD**, it might be rank-deficient (i.e., some eigenvalues are 0, so its rank is <n< n).

### **Summary of Properties**

|QQ type|Eigenvalues λi\lambda_i|Invertible?|Full Rank?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)|λi≥0\lambda_i \geq 0|**Only if no zero eigenvalues**|**Only if no zero eigenvalues**|
|Positive Definite (PD)|λi>0\lambda_i > 0|**Always**|**Always**|

## **3. Implications for QP and Optimization Algorithms**

### **(a) When QQ is Positive Definite (PD)**

- The objective function is **strictly convex**, meaning there is a **unique global minimum**.
- Methods like **Newton’s method, interior-point methods, and gradient-based algorithms** work efficiently because the Hessian (QQ) is always invertible.

### **(b) When QQ is Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)**

- The problem is still **convex**, but the minimum **might not be unique** (if QQ has zero eigenvalues, meaning some directions in the space are "flat").
- **Optimization algorithms may need special handling**, such as:
    - Using **regularization** (adding a small multiple of the identity, Q+ϵIQ + \epsilon I, to make QQ invertible).
    - Using **methods that handle rank-deficient Hessians**, such as **conjugate gradient methods**.

### **(c) When QQ is Indefinite (Not PSD)**

- The problem is **non-convex**, meaning there might be **local minima and saddle points**.
- Many convex optimization methods (like interior-point or gradient descent) **do not work well** without modifications.
- Special methods like **trust-region methods** or **global optimization techniques** are needed.

## **4. Key Takeaways for QP Algorithms**

- **Convex QP problems (where QQ is PSD)** can be solved efficiently using:
    
    - **Interior-point methods**
    - **Active-set methods**
    - **Gradient-based methods**
- If QQ is **rank-deficient (some zero eigenvalues)**:
    
    - The solution **may not be unique**.
    - Algorithms like **Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse** or **regularization** techniques can help.
- If QQ is **indefinite (not PSD)**:
    
    - The problem is **non-convex**.
    - Need **global optimization** techniques (e.g., branch-and-bound, trust-region methods).

# Well-conditioned vs ill-conditioned

You're welcome! Now let's dive into **matrix conditioning** and its impact on choosing optimization algorithms.

---

## **1. What is Conditioning?**

The **conditioning of a matrix** refers to how sensitive its solutions are to small perturbations in input data. It is measured by the **condition number**:

κ(Q)=λmax⁡λmin⁡\kappa(Q) = \frac{\lambda_{\max}}{\lambda_{\min}}

where λmax⁡\lambda_{\max} and λmin⁡\lambda_{\min} are the largest and smallest nonzero eigenvalues of QQ.

- **Well-conditioned matrix**: κ(Q)≈1\kappa(Q) \approx 1 (low condition number).
- **Ill-conditioned matrix**: κ(Q)≫1\kappa(Q) \gg 1 (high condition number).

A high condition number means small errors in data or computations **cause large changes in the solution**.

---

## **2. Impact of Conditioning on Optimization Algorithms**

|Conditioning|Properties|Algorithm Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|**Well-conditioned** (κ(Q)≈1)(\kappa(Q) \approx 1)|Eigenvalues are close in magnitude → stable computations|**Direct methods** (e.g., Cholesky, Newton's method) work well|
|**Moderately ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)(\kappa(Q) somewhat large)|Some eigenvalues are small → solution may have some numerical instability|**Preconditioned iterative methods** (e.g., Conjugate Gradient with preconditioning) can improve efficiency|
|**Highly ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)≫1)(\kappa(Q) \gg 1)|Eigenvalues vary drastically → severe instability|**Regularization techniques** (Tikhonov, adding ϵI\epsilon I), **iterative methods** (Conjugate Gradient, Gradient Descent)|

---

## **3. When to Use Different Algorithms Based on Conditioning**

### **(a) Direct Methods (Good for Well-Conditioned Problems)**

1. **Cholesky Decomposition** (only for **positive definite QQ**)
    
    - Factorizes Q=LLTQ = LL^T, where LL is a lower triangular matrix.
    - **Fast** and numerically stable for well-conditioned problems.
    - Used in **interior-point methods** for convex QPs.
2. **LU / QR Decomposition**
    
    - Works for general matrices (not just PD).
    - More robust than Cholesky for near-singular matrices but still struggles with ill-conditioned problems.
3. **Newton’s Method**
    
    - Uses the Hessian QQ directly in updates.
    - Fast for **small, well-conditioned problems**.
    - If QQ is ill-conditioned, Newton's steps may be unstable.

---

### **(b) Iterative Methods (Better for Ill-Conditioned Problems)**

1. **Gradient Descent (GD)**
    
    - Converges **slowly** when QQ is ill-conditioned because it moves faster in well-conditioned directions and slower in ill-conditioned ones.
    - The convergence rate depends on κ(Q)\kappa(Q), roughly O(κ(Q))O(\kappa(Q)).
2. **Conjugate Gradient (CG) (Best for SPD Matrices)**
    
    - Faster than GD, especially for large, sparse problems.
    - Converges in at most nn iterations, but in practice much faster.
    - **Preconditioning** (using P≈Q−1P \approx Q^{-1} to reduce κ(Q)\kappa(Q)) improves efficiency.
3. **Quasi-Newton Methods (e.g., BFGS, L-BFGS)**
    
    - Approximates the Hessian QQ without computing it directly.
    - More robust than Newton’s method for **ill-conditioned** problems.

---

### **(c) Regularization Techniques (Fixing Ill-Conditioned Matrices)**

When QQ is very ill-conditioned, solutions are unstable. Some common fixes:

1. **Tikhonov Regularization** (a.k.a. Ridge Regression)
    
    - Modify QQ to Q+λIQ + \lambda I, where λ>0\lambda > 0 is small.
    - This increases the smallest eigenvalue, reducing κ(Q)\kappa(Q).
    - Used in **machine learning** and **numerical optimization**.
2. **Damped Newton’s Method**
    
    - Instead of using QQ directly, update using a modified step size to prevent large jumps.
3. **Preconditioning**
    
    - Replace QQ with P−1QP^{-1}Q, where PP is an approximation of QQ.
    - Reduces κ(Q)\kappa(Q), improving convergence of CG and GD.

## **4. Summary: How to Choose an Algorithm Based on Conditioning**

|**Conditioning**|**Preferred Algorithm**|**Techniques to Improve Convergence**|
|---|---|---|
|**Well-conditioned** (κ(Q)≈1)(\kappa(Q) \approx 1)|**Cholesky, Newton’s method, Conjugate Gradient**|No special modifications needed|
|**Moderately ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)≫1)(\kappa(Q) \gg 1)|**Preconditioned CG, BFGS, Regularized Newton**|Preconditioning, regularization (Q+λIQ + \lambda I)|
|**Highly ill-conditioned** (κ(Q)≫106)(\kappa(Q) \gg 10^6)|**Gradient Descent (slow), Regularized CG or Quasi-Newton methods**|Strong preconditioning, Tikhonov regularization|

---

## **5. Final Takeaways**

- **Well-conditioned problems** allow efficient direct methods (Cholesky, Newton, CG).
- **Ill-conditioned problems** need iterative methods (CG, BFGS) with **preconditioning or regularization**.
- **Highly ill-conditioned problems** require extreme modifications, like **damped updates or regularization techniques**.
