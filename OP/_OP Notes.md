*Project*. No deadline. Send to professor each step, to check. Use whatever language you want (python, c++, matlab, ...) for the report.
Half october to form groups. List of projects. Choose one.
Use a private repo.
Try to use clear functions and API.
It is a plus to design it to be user-friendly, but not expected.
First the report, then the code. Show that you understood what you did in the report.

*Multi-objective Optimization*
No total order as in R.
Pareto Frontier.
Two solutions.
First. We can use a parameter to add the function in the other. Like a risk-adjusted return for investment.
Second. Decide the maximum risk.
So we'll use a one-objective function with constraints.

*Algebra*
If the scalar product is >0 then the cos(a) is >a (because of the geometric interpretation) then the directions of vectors are on the same side.
