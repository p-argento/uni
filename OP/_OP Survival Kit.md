[MATLAB Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f50sQYjNRA&t=6345s) the first half is a must to understand what the professor does during lectures

[StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) also useful for data mining

[Visually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@VisuallyExplained/playlists) with Visual explanations of algorithms.

[3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=FnSUx1zAzgiZF1yS) must watch to review linear algebra

# Books
---
[THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST BOOK OF THE COURSE](https://www.math.uci.edu/~qnie/Publications/NumericalOptimization.pdf) "J. Nocedal, S.J. Wright, Numerical Optimization". It is often cited by the professor in the slides. It is very clear. And the topics are the same of the lectures.

[Book on github](https://indrag49.github.io/Numerical-Optimization/) It looks like a summary of "J. Nocedal, S.J. Wright, Numerical Optimization".

# Datasets
---
[Optimization Test Problems](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html) The functions listed below are some of the common functions and datasets used for testing optimization algorithms. The professor used this dataset many times to get strange functions.

The [CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset.

[youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k&si=pEbwcF_n09_23vUA) by Gilbert Strang
Linear algebra concepts are key for understanding and creating machine learning algorithms, especially as applied to deep learning and neural networks. This course reviews linear algebra with applications to probability and statistics and optimization–and above all a full explanation of deep learning.""
