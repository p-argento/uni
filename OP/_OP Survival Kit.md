[MATLAB Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f50sQYjNRA&t=6345s) the first half is a must to understand what the professor does during lectures.

[StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) also useful for data mining.

[Visually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@VisuallyExplained/playlists) with Visual explanations of algorithms.

[ritvikmath](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvcbYUQ5t0UH2MS_B6maLNJhK0jNyPJUY&si=LEUI2PVXL5K2jY6k) has some interesting videos on the math behind data science concepts.

# Books
---
[THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST BOOK OF THE COURSE](https://www.math.uci.edu/~qnie/Publications/NumericalOptimization.pdf) "J. Nocedal, S.J. Wright, Numerical Optimization". It is often cited by the professor in the slides. It is very clear. And the topics are the same of the lectures.

[Book on github](https://indrag49.github.io/Numerical-Optimization/) It looks like a summary of "J. Nocedal, S.J. Wright, Numerical Optimization".

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/). I like it. And it's free. There is both the R and Python version.

# Datasets
---
[Optimization Test Problems](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html) The functions listed below are some of the common functions and datasets used for testing optimization algorithms. The professor used this dataset many times to get strange functions.

The [CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset. 

The [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). We currently maintain 653 datasets as a service to the machine learning community. Here, you can donate and find datasets used by millions of people all around the world!

[Italian Public Datasets](https://github.com/italia/awesome-italian-public-datasets) shared by Geospatial Analytics professor.

# Math Review
---
[3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=FnSUx1zAzgiZF1yS) must watch to review linear algebra.

[Multivariable Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7) for things like gradient, lagrangian and so on.

[youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k&si=pEbwcF_n09_23vUA) by Gilbert Strang
Linear algebra concepts are key for understanding and creating machine learning algorithms, especially as applied to deep learning and neural networks. This course reviews linear algebra with applications to probability and statistics and optimization–and above all a full explanation of deep learning.""

[num-opt-solutions](https://github.com/MariaLavrovskaya/num-opt-solutions) This repository stores solutions to Numerical Optimisation problems. Most of the algorithms provided are implementations based on pseudocode provided in Numerical Optimization by Jorge Nocedal, Stephen Wright.
