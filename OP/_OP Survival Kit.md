[MATLAB Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f50sQYjNRA&t=6345s) the first half is a must to understand what the professor does during lectures

[StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) useful also for data mining

[Michel Bierblaire](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL10NOnsbP5Q7wNrYItE2GhKq05cVov97e&si=Rd85llfgFQAeddFU) on Descent Methods

[Visually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@VisuallyExplained) with Visual explanations of algorithms.

[3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=FnSUx1zAzgiZF1yS) must watch



# Books

[Book on github](https://indrag49.github.io/Numerical-Optimization/) with many interesting explanations like line search, conjugate gradient, quasi-newton, etc. (*THIS IS GOLD*)



# Datasets
---

[Optimization Test Problems](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html) The functions listed below are some of the common functions and datasets used for testing optimization algorithms.

The [CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset.

Linear algebra concepts are key for understanding and creating machine learning algorithms, especially as applied to deep learning and neural networks. This course reviews linear algebra with applications to probability and statistics and optimization–and above all a full explanation of deep learning.
