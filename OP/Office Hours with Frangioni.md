1. Primal Log-barrier
	1. lambda is not hyperparam, it should go to zero
	2. the solution must be close E-6 with solvers
	3. 
2. Dual Log-barrier
	1. add extra equality constrained 
	2. 
3. Primal-Dual
	1. easier
	2. look at sheet written by him
	3. hessian is not required
	4. kkt for dual
	5. exploit the box-constrained IPBCQP


another office hour
1. look code first, then lecture on svm
2.
