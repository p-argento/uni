7. Constrained Continuous Optimization Methods
8. Mixed-integer Optimization Models

## Project
No deadline. Send to professor each step, to check. Use whatever language you want (python, c++, matlab, ...) for the report.
Half october to form groups. List of projects. Choose one.
Use a private repo.
Try to use clear functions and API.
It is a plus to design it to be user-friendly, but not expected.
First the report, then the code. Show that you understood what you did in the report.
Have a look at the [[Guidelines_4_Projects_ODS23.pdf]]
