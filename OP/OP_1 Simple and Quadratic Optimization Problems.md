# Outline & Wrap up
---
Outline
1. Optimization Problems
2. Optimization is difficult
3. Simple functions, Univariate case
4. Simple functions, Multivariate case
5. Multivariate Quadratic Case: Gradient Method
6. Multivariate Quadratic Case: Conjugate Gradient Method
7. Multivariate Quadratic Case: Factorization

Wrap up
1. Optimization problems are difficult, so start with simple problems to get the intuition
2. Use a simpler model, that looks like the real complex function, but that it is not
3. Linear Functions are super easy
4. Quadratic functions can go up to NP-hard

My Point
1. Basically trying to optimize very simple problems, both univariate and multivariate
2. Then specifically look at the quadratic case, which is the simplest multivariate
3. Next step will be with more complicated UNIVARIATE functions
