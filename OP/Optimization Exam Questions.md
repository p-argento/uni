1. write kkt conditions related to the project
2. write kkt conditions with an additional given constraint (eg. | | x | | = r)
3. write the barrier function related to the project
4. say something about lagrangian duality
5. how to solve the unconstrained project if it was constrained
6. what other algorithms from slides we could have used to solve our problem (eg Frank-Wolfe)
7. what are some troublesome cases for Cholesky
8. what are some preconditioning methods (Frank-Wolfe?)
9. what happens if we sum the identity matrix to a positive semidefinite matrix with the identity strictly positive (Q + cI , c>0)
