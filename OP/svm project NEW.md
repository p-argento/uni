# News
- 1/09/24: call with Duc, we are fixing the draft of the report so that tomorrow we can send it to frangioni. We decided to split the work for now, duc will do the barrier method and I will do the general purpose solver. We set 20/9 as the deadline to meet again and send everything to frangioni.

# General-Purpose Solver

The idea here is to use the [quadratic solver](https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/basic/quadratic_program.html) from the library CVXPY.
To do so, we need to formulate the SVM problem as a quadratic programming problem.

I am investigating if the formulation of [libsvm](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) can be used, or if I need to do it from scratch. Following this [guide](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf)
