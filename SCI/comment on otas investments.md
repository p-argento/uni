SaaS models are particularly viable in this space given the scalability and financial/operational requirements for hosting and running an AI app. There are many travel organizations out there that won’t be able to harness AI on their own, such as destination marketing organizations (DMOs) and tourism boards; hospitality groups; niche apps for certain kinds of travel like fishing or skiing; airlines; cruise lines; and even bus lines.

Another way to drive revenue from these types of organizations is by using a commission/affiliate model. Travel AI products can use this option effectively but need to practice moderation, because to overdo it could undermine the usefulness of their product.
