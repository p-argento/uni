# 1. Competitive Intelligence Definition
## Intelligence
Competitive Intelligence (or Corporate Intelligence or CI) involves gathering and analyzing information about your competitors, target customers and market.
Data enables to make contextual, data-led decisions.
The ultimate goal is to establish or enhance *competitive advantage*.

What is competitive advantage?
As students, a competitive advantage can be related to getting better positions than other students.
Needs are getting more complex.

Today, the amount of information is too much.
But we have tools.

## Intelligence Types
Types
1. HUM-INT (Human Intelligence)
	1. having a good network is the best way to avoid undercover operations
	2. go to the bar where employees of your dream company go
2. SIG-INT (Signal Intelligence)
	1. intercept calls, emails,..
3. GEO-INT (Geospatial Intelligence)
	1. satellite images, ...
4. MAS-INT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence)
5. OS-INT (*Open Source Intelligence*)
	1. sources that are not protected and can be accessed in a legal way
	2. it is a recent practice

### Open Source Intelligence
1. Definition: Intelligence collected from publicly available sources.
2. Sources: Newspapers, journals, radio, television, websites, and social media platforms.
3. Applications: Gathering information that is available in the public domain, often used for research, situation analysis, and decision-making support.

The goal is to collect knowledge to make decision, not to get more knowledge like researchers.

## Generative AI
Generative Adversarial Networks.
One NN is the painter, the other is the policemen.
When the policemen is not able to distinguish AI painted images from web images, then it is a good output.

10% of company revenue is invested on marketing on average.

Transform questions framed with framing tools into a project with project management tools.
Using these tools appropriately decreases the complexity of a project.

## 1. Everything starts with a question
Remember that the final goal is competitive advantage, meaning have more knowledge.
So we need question to better understand competitive environment.

Who asks SCI Questions? Strategic Management. They know the domain, while the analyst knows data. The combination should generate insights.
Where can I find interesting questions to ask?
Research papers, genAI, ...

In the context of SCI, there are 2 topics.
1. KIT (Key Intelligence Topics)
	1. key questions that competitive intelligence professionals are trying to answer about what's happening outside of their organizations
2. KIQ (Key Intelligence Questions)
	1. specific questions to understand within a given topic
> Be aware of useless marketing material online.

The level of abstraction is the degree of detail of a certain object.
Also questions have a position in the scale of abstraction.
Both abstract and specific questions can be problematic.
Abstract question
1. can be too broad
2. cannot measure the quality of the answer (loose scope)
3. do not lead to action
Specific Questions
1. can be too narrow too soon (funneling)

*How do I articulate my KIT?*
Two key points
1. clarity
	1. connection between questions and activity planned
2. specificity
	1. avoid ambiguity and fuzziness

1. Who are your top 3 competitors?
2. What is your target audience?
3. How do you plan to measure the effectiveness of the project?
4. At what degree of personalization do you want the product?
	1. What degree of customization is required in the product?
5. How important is it for the technology to be accessible by all?
6. Is it a standalone project or is it part of a bigger project? Is it relevant in developing the project

What degree of customization is required in the product?
How do you plan to measure the effectiveness of the project?
How important is it for the technology to be accessible by all?
Is it a standalone project or is it part of a bigger project?
What is the model for evaluating students.
