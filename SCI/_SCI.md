## Course Structure
Steps
1. Plan
	1. not user anymore, but a customer (boss, company or professor)
	2. define expectational needs of the customer
	3. each group will act as consultant helping customer to start a company in a certain field
2. Gather
	1. most important and intense activity
	2. gather and EVALUATE, is the information solid? can I trust it? is it first hand or second hand information?
	3. gathering means also understanding data
3. Analyze
	1. the goal is making knowledge from data
	2. using the right tools to make knowledge is hard
	3. text mining and NLP are the main tools because most of the intelligence data is unstructured data in text format
4. Interpret
	1. make an informational output
	2. like a dashboard, a report, a business plan, a chart, presentation

Give a Presentation and prepare a Dashboard.
Think as a data scientist. The goal must be accessible for the customer.
Groups up to 3-4 people.

If a problem is not solvable, probably there is something wrong in the plan, in framing the problem
