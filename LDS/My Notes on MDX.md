The WHERE clause describes the slicer axis in an MDX query. It acts as something like an invisible, extra axis in the query, slicing the values that appear in the cells in the result set; unlike the SQL WHERE clause it does not directly affect what appears on the rows axis of the query. The functionality of the SQL WHERE clause is available through other MDX functions such as the FILTER function.
