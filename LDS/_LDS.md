## Exam
Ruggieri first. Then Monreale. Write it in the notes on valutami.
Better oral exam with the group.

## Project
Write the name in the spreadsheet.
Database release in mid-october.
First deadline beginning december.
Second (and last) deadline December 27.

Be prepared to download a VM of 60GB to use MS on Mac.
*is there an open source source to do ALL these tasks?*

You can use spyder, pycharm (I suggest you NOT to use jupyter, because it is better to be efficient, using functions and cleaning data once).
DO NOT use duplicated code for each code, I DO NOT want to see copy and paste. Use functions to reduce the number of lines of code. Image that the professor is another developer that wants to run your code. Add comments in every part of the code.

Do the exercises in the slides about python. You will be evaluated in the efficiency of the code.

Use exceptions !! and handle them.

Do all exercises.
Try the VPN.
Install management studio.
