## Foundations of logic
Need for formalization to avoid ambiguities.
NOT can be $\neg$ or $\sim$
Examples.

## Propositional Logic
A proposition is a sentence that is either true or false.
Propositional Variables (like engines, doors,...) can be True (T) or False (F).
$$Var(p)\rightarrow\{T,F\}$$

## Syntax

![[Pasted image 20240221143316.png]]

## Semantics
Operators
1. negative
2. conjunction
3. disjunction (or inclusive OR) $\rightarrow\vee$
4. exclusive OR $\rightarrow\oplus$
	1. same as $(p\vee q)\wedge\neg(p\wedge q)$
5. implication $\rightarrow$

*Note on implication*

> My suggestion is to use parenthesis even if  not necessary

## Underestanding Implication

Games.
Look at the Truth Table to understand implications.

Opposite
1. converse
2. inverse

Same meaning
1. contrapositive (same)

Understand
1. necessary condition
2. sufficient condition

If x is a necessary condition for y, then y is a sufficient condition for x.
Since having air to breathe is necessary for human life, if follows that the existence of human life suffices for the existence of air.

## Biconditional (or equivalence)
Necessary and sufficient condition.
“p if and only if q”
