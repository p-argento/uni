## Functions
Functions are also called mappings or trasformations.
Injective $f(a)=f(b)\implies a=b$
Surjective if image and codomain coincide.
Bijection if injective and surjective, is the one-to-one correspondence.

A property of bijection is that cardinality of the two sets must be the same.
No inverse exists unless f is a bijection.
