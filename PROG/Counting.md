# Permutations and combinations

## Permutation
When order is important.
With permutation, you have $$n!$$How to remember it is a factorial?

## Combinations
When order is NOT important.
Just divide the permutation by repeated elements.
Meaning $$P(n,r)=C(n,r)\cdot P(r,r)\longrightarrow C(n,r)=\frac{P(n,r)}{P(n,r)}=\frac{n!/(n-r)!}{r!/(n-r)!}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$$
