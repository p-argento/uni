Split until the splitting attributes directly leads to a specific class, in a sense that it does not need to be split again to find a specific class.
For example, if 'home owner=yes' then the class is for sure 'no'.

	When the slip is not binary, who tells me what is the right split?
	There could be more than one tree that fits the same data.
	Use greedy algorithm, but it is not possible to grasp the real optimum.
