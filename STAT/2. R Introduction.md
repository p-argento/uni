We start from scratch, gradually introducing more advanced packages.
## R Basics
R is an interpreted language (NOT compiled).
A vector is made by items of the same type.
But if the vector is mixed, it will be upcasted to the more generic type of the vector.
An integer is more generic than a bool, a string is more generic than an integer.
*Vectors are 1-based.*
In `[4:10]` he end position is included.

*Named vectors* are like dictionaries in python. But they can be accessed both with keys and indexes.
```R
> # named vectors 
> x <- c(red="Huey", blue="Dewey", green="Louie") 
> x["red"]
   red 
"Huey" 
> x[1]
   red 
"Huey" 
> x
    red    blue   green 
 "Huey" "Dewey" "Louie" 
> names(x)
[1] "red"   "blue"  "green"
> unname(x) # vector without names
[1] "Huey"  "Dewey" "Louie"
> names(x) = c() # discard names
> x
[1] "Huey"  "Dewey" "Louie"
> names(x) = c("first", "second", "third")
> x
  first  second   third 
 "Huey" "Dewey" "Louie" 
```


`LETTERS[1:3] `# letters is a predefined vector, here it is used to name rows
And rows can be accessed using letters
```R
> x= matrix(1:12,nrow=3,byrow=T)
> x
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    2    3    4
[2,]    5    6    7    8
[3,]    9   10   11   12
> rownames(x) <- LETTERS[1:3]
> x
  [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
A    1    2    3    4
B    5    6    7    8
C    9   10   11   12
```

*factor* is a vector of categories.
What is the difference with a vector of strings, in the factor only those items can be used, meaning that categories are fixed.

```R
> cut( 1:10, breaks = c(0, 3, 10)) # discretization into intervals
 [1] (0,3]  (0,3]  (0,3]  (3,10] (3,10] (3,10] (3,10] (3,10] (3,10] (3,10]
Levels: (0,3] (3,10]
```

*dataframe* is a list of vectors or factors of the same length.

## Conditional Statement
Unlike python, curly brackets are necessary for multiple statements.

## Loops
Loops are typically inefficient in interpreted languages.
Use implicit loops like 
- `lapply(ls,f)` which returns a list of results
- `sapply(ls,f)` which return an array of results
Useful also drawing plots.
## Functions
For example
```R
max = function(x,y){
	if(x>y)
		ret = x # assign the return value
	else
		ret = y
	ret # returns the variable ret
}
> max(3,5)
```

Functions pass by value.
