## Coding
The scripts are named according to lessons, not sequentially.
## Exam
Written and oral exam.
The project (and discussion) replace the written exam.
## Outline
The program covers the basic methodologies, techniques and tools of statistical analysis. This includes basic knowledge of probability theory, random variables, convergence theorems, statistical models, estimation theory, hypothesis testing, bayesian inference, causal reasoning. Other topics covered include bootstrap, expectation-maximization, and applications to data science problems. Finally the program covers the use of the language R for statistical analysis.
