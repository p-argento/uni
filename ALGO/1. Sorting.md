## The Sorting Problem
Input: sequence `A[1,n]` of n elements
Goal: permutation `A'[1,n]` of A (without creating a new element) such that $$A'[i]\leq A'[i+1]\qquad\forall i\in[1,n-1]$$
All the books about algorithms are 1-based (NOT 0-based like python).
Keep this in mind when turning pseudo-code into real-code.

What is the idea for ordering a vector?
Never use an external number to replace a number which was supposed to be removed. It is a patch and it is wrong.
Swap the number to be removed with the last one and remove the last one.

Instead of creating a new array, it is a better idea to divide the array in sorted and unsorted sub-arrays. Each time a min is computed, the number goes to the left and the index of the unsorted sub-array is increased by 1 (started from 0).
This algorithm is called *selection sort*.

Iterating the array n times and swapping each time the consecutive element if smaller. It is called *bubble sort*. Never use this, it is one of the worst.

Another approach is place each number in its correct position. Start with a one-number array and increasingly add items in the right position.
This is 

Which one is the best?
