## The Sorting Problem
Input: sequence `A[1,n]` of n elements
Goal: permutation `A'[1,n]` of A (without creating a new element) such that $$A'[i]\leq A'[i+1]\qquad\forall i\in[1,n-1]$$
All the books about algorithms are 1-based (NOT 0-based like python).
Keep this in mind when turning pseudo-code into real-code.

What is the idea for ordering a vector?
Never use an external number to replace a number which was supposed to be removed. It is a patch and it is wrong.
Swap the number to be removed with the last one and remove the last one.

Instead of creating a new array, it is a better idea to divide the array in sorted and unsorted sub-arrays. Each time a min is computed, the number goes to the left and the index of the unsorted sub-array is increased by 1 (started from 0).
This algorithm is called *selection sort*.

Iterating the array n times and swapping each time the consecutive element if smaller. It is called *bubble sort*. Never use this, it is one of the worst.

Another approach is place each number in its correct position. Start with a one-number array and increasingly add items in the right position.
This is

## Insertion Sort

>The complexity of an algorithm is the number of steps required in order to find a solution.

It is an "inplace sort", meaning that modifies the original array.
It doesn't need extra space for creating a new array.
We process the array and when the i-th term is not sorted, it will be moved backwards to its correct position, comparing with each antecedent until we found the smaller or equal.

Pseudocode.
i is the antecedent, j is the item to be moved.
```pseudocode
InsertionSort(A)
	for j=2 to length
		key = A[j]
		// insert key in already sorted A[1,i-1]
		i = j - 1
		while i > 0 and A[i] > key
			A[i+1] = A[i]
			i = i - 1
		A[i+1] = key
```
