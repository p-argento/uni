## Syllabus
1. Introduction and basic definitions: algorithm, problem, instance.
2. Computational complexity analysis of algorithms.
3. Sorting: Mergesort, Quicksort and Heapsort.
4. Searching: Binary Search, Binary Search Tree, Trie, and Hashing.
5. Algorithms on Trees: representation and traversals.
6. Algorithms on Graphs: representation, traversals, and most important problems.
7. External memory model: sorting and searching.

## Exam
The date is for the written lab, which is on meet.
Not mandatory to do lab and theory in the same appello.
A week after the lab, there's the theory.
Theory is written in 45 min and oral afterwards, in the same day.

Written Exam Exercises
1. simulation of one of the algorithms seen in class (if done it's 18)
2. visit of a tree (with RECURSION)
3. non-trivial modification of some of the algorithms seen

Each week, there's a jupyter notebook with exercises.
Then, few days before the exam, they should be submitted.

## Some notes from lectures
*Programming Priorities*
1. Correctness
2. Efficiency
3. Readability

Use set and dictionaries instead of lists, to be more efficient.
You're using lists too much probably.

*Analysis of Algorithms*
The goal is to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.
Two issues: time and space.
Mostly, we will talk about time.
