Loan Application

Once a loan application has been approved by the loan provider, an acceptance pack is prepared and sent to the customer. 

The acceptance pack includes a repayment schedule which the customer needs to agree upon by sending the signed documents back to the loan provider. 

The latter then verifies the repayment agreement: 
if the applicant disagreed with the repayment schedule, the loan provider cancels the application;
if the applicant agreed, the loan provider approves the application. 
In either case, the process completes with the loan provider notifying the applicant of the application status.
