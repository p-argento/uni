Viability

Defining the problem is crucial for MEASURING.
If we focus only on the solution and not on the problem, we FUNNEL to much, not exploring.

Level of abstraction:  is the degree of generalization.

Technological Push and Market (or Need) Pull.

Is a niche too big or too small? Count the number of words to define the persona.

A divergence method is to negate one of the common attributes of the user.

2. a student needs reliable transport in order to attend be on time in classes at school /uni
	We believe that people commuting in italian public transport are not completely satisfied on the availability of the public transportation (not enough frequency, delays).
	
	So if we randomly send a back up (train, bus, etc) to continue the route on time, and then ask people about the service.
	
	Then more than x% of people will be satisfied.

4. a businessman needs higher quality alternatives to travel more comfortably and conveniently.
	We belive that cleaness and comfort in italian public transport is not currently what users desire.
	
	So if we randomly ask people on public transport apps about the cleaness and comfort in their last trip.
	
	Then more than x% of people will be dissatisfied.


1. a tourist needs to pay easily the bus in order to enjoy the trip without fines.
	We belive that payment information and methods are not enough for customers particularly for tourists.(making it hard for them and eventually allowing some of them to free ride because of lack of understanding.) 
	
	So if we put more information about how to use the public transport in the stops, in the stations, in the more touristic places, and in the aiports.
	
	Then more than x% of tourists will know how to use public transport and be prepared for the advantages and limitations

5. a person with lower income needs incentives based on income to use public transport more often
	We belive that many people would use public transport more if the ticket price was based on the isee.
	
	So if we ask people at the bus station (or on the app) to provide their isee in order to get discounts
	
	Then x% of people would get access to discounts and therefore use public transport more.


7. an environmentalist needs more sustainable options in public mobility in order not to harm environment with cars.
	We believe that environmentalist might be interested in more sustainable ways in and across cities.
	
	So if we pretend to have an electric car available for moving across cities and collect reservations for using it.
	
	Then more than x% will use this green transport vehicle to travel across cities.

How to be empathetic and use data?

SDGs are useful evaluation methods.
Design methods are hidden everywhere and are useful to look at reality differently.

3. self-reflection / brainstorming
4. Reviews and feedback analysis
5. 

ANALYSIS OF NEEDS


FAI-related methods

TIDYING THINGS UP
Identifying users' needs.

1. Analysing website of FAI
	1. Reading informations, who they work with
	2. Examples: board, volunteers, schools, donors, ...
	3. **User Personas**: Create user personas based on the information gathered from the website. Develop profiles that represent the different types of users and stakeholders connected to FAI.

2. Social Network analysis
	1. Analyse follower and likes
	2. Posts with more likes, comments (needs), ...
	3. Facebook (likes), Instagram (customer profiles), X (B2B), Linkedin (workers)
	4. Explore the various places managed by FAI and read the reviews (facebook)

3. Benchmark
	1. Explore the website of other nations which successfully managed their museums, etc. (like UK and France).
	2. also to identify potential users not yet following FAI

5. Observation of users participating at events
	1. ask to fill a survey provided through a QR code

6. Interviews to stakeholders
	1. to workers, board (maybe), volunteers
	2. what kind of customers do they look for?

7. Writing need hypothesis (we believe that the user...so, if we... then we will see...) through self-reflection / brainstorming

Here's an expanded list of methods to identify users and their needs for the Fondo Ambiente Italiano (FAI):

  

1. **Website Analysis**:

Goal:
Create user personas based on the information gathered from the website. Develop profiles that represent the different types of users and stakeholders connected to FAI.

Tasks:
1. Scrutinize the main content, pages, and structure of the FAI website.
2. Review the "About Us" section to gain insights on the mission, vision, and objectives.
3. Investigate partnership and collaboration pages to find out who they associate with.
4. Review any testimonials or feedback sections from users.
5. Identify any calls-to-action that indicate specific user engagement points.


6. **Social Network Analysis**:

Goal: **Follower and Engagement Analysis**: Analyze FAI's social media followers and engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and shares. Identify patterns in posts that receive the most interaction to uncover user interests and needs. And **Platform-Specific Insights**

Tasks:
1. Track engagement metrics such as shares, likes, and mentions.
2. Determine which content themes resonate the most with the audience.
3. Analyze the demographics and interests of the followers on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.  
5. For platforms like LinkedIn, examine employee profiles, organizational updates, and any interaction with other businesses.
6. Review user-generated content, feedback and comments left by visitors on FAI-managed locations on platforms like TripAdvisor, Google Maps.


3. **Benchmarking**:

Goals:
   1. **Comparative Analysis**: organizations in other countries known for successfully managing cultural and heritage sites 
   2. Identify *best practices*
   3. **Audience Gap Analysis**: Evaluate whether there are potential user groups that FAI hasn't tapped into yet.

Tasks:
1. Study the websites and online presence of organizations in other countries known for successfully managing cultural and heritage sites (e.g., UK's National Trust or France's Louvre).
3. Identify best practices, like tracking any influencers or prominent figures who endorse or collaborate with these entities, which FAI can potentially engage with.
4. **Audience Gap Analysis**: Evaluate whether there are potential user groups that FAI could target. 
  

4. **Observation of User Participation at Events**:


   1. **On-Site Surveys**: Real-time understanding of user needs, by interacting with users attending FAI events.

Tasks:
1. Document behaviours, interactions, and engagement of users during FAI events.
2. Conduct on-the-spot feedback sessions, by providing QR code surveys to collect immediate feedback on their experiences, preferences, and needs.
3. Use tech tools like heat maps to see which areas or exhibits are the most popular during events.


5. **Interviews with Stakeholders**:

   1. **Stakeholder Perspectives**: Conduct interviews with various stakeholders, including FAI workers, board members (if willing), and volunteers. Explore their insights into the kinds of visitors or customers they are targeting and what they perceive as the primary needs of these visitors.

   2. **User Expectations**: Inquire about the expectations and goals of different stakeholder groups in engaging with FAI, as this can shed light on the intended user experience.

Tasks:
1. Conduct structured interviews with a diverse set of stakeholders, including employees, partners, volunteers, and regular visitors.
2. Use open-ended questions to draw out detailed insights and stories.
3. Ask about the challenges faced by users and the gaps in the current offerings.
  

6. **Hypothesis Development**:

   1. **User-Centered Hypotheses**: Encourage self-reflection and brainstorming within the FAI team to generate need hypotheses. Develop statements like "We believe that the user visiting FAI's historic sites is seeking..." and then determine actions to validate these hypotheses. This can be a proactive way to guide user-centric improvements.

Tasks:
1. Develop hypotheses based on observations, data, and insights.
2. Design pilot projects or initiatives to test these hypotheses.
3. Iterate based on the outcomes, refining the approach as needed.

7. **Focus Groups**

Goal: deeper understand of needs. In practice.

Tasks:
1. Organize sessions with a select group of users and stakeholders.
2. Engage in deep-dive discussions on specific topics or challenges.
3. Use the feedback to refine FAI's offerings and strategies.

These methods provide a comprehensive approach to understanding the diverse users and their needs related to the Fondo Ambiente Italiano. By combining data from different sources and engaging with stakeholders, FAI can tailor its offerings and communication to better serve its audience.

Don't stick to one level of abstraction.
And measure it.

Using brainstorming you should measure the number and quality of ideas.
To converge, you have to measure.
Measure is the connection between ideas and reality.
In the divergent part you don't need the connection with the real world, but in the convergence you need expertise to measure how things are in reality.
*Use chatGPT for converging saying if it's good or not*

In ML, the prompt is called "one-shot learning".
