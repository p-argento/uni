**Professor's suggestions**
1. [Word Embedding and Word2Vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa)
2. Brainstorming types
3. always insert the prompt when using chatGPT (and which AI)
4. [[use AI in more innovative ways]]
5. the form is REALLY important (font, highlighting, images, tables, ecc)

### Introduction

Desirability
Feasibility
Viability

Defining the problem is crucial for MEASURING.
If we focus only on the solution and not on the problem, we FUNNEL to much, not exploring.

Level of abstraction:  is the degree of generalization.

Technological Push and Market (or Need) Pull.

Is a niche too big or too small? Count the number of words to define the persona.

A divergence method is to negate one of the common attributes of the user.

### Experiment Examples

1. a student needs reliable transport in order to attend be on time in classes at school /uni

We believe that people commuting in italian public transport are not completely satisfied on the availability of the public transportation (not enough frequency, delays).

So if we randomly send a back up (train, bus, etc) to continue the route on time, and then ask people about the service.

Then more than x% of people will be satisfied.

2. a businessman needs higher quality alternatives to travel more comfortably and conveniently.

We belive that cleaness and comfort in italian public transport is not currently what users desire.

So if we randomly ask people on public transport apps about the cleaness and comfort in their last trip.

Then more than x% of people will be dissatisfied.


1. a tourist needs to pay easily the bus in order to enjoy the trip without fines.

We belive that payment information and methods are not enough for customers particularly for tourists.(making it hard for them and eventually allowing some of them to free ride because of lack of understanding.)Â 

So if we put more information about how to use the public transport in the stops, in the stations, in the more touristic places, and in the aiports.

Then more than x% of tourists will know how to use public transport and be prepared for the advantages and limitations

1. a person with lower income needs incentives based on income to use public transport more often

We belive that many people would use public transport more if the ticket price was based on the isee.

So if we ask people at the bus station (or on the app) to provide their isee in order to get discounts

Then x% of people would get access to discounts and therefore use public transport more.


7. an environmentalist needs more sustainable options in public mobility in order not to harm environment with cars.

We believe that environmentalist might be interested in more sustainable ways in and across cities.

So if we pretend to have an electric car available for moving across cities and collect reservations for using it.

Then more than x% will use this green transport vehicle to travel across cities.



### Random Stuff

SDGs are useful evaluation methods.
Don't stick to one level of abstraction.
And measure it.

**Importance of Measuring**
Using brainstorming you should measure the number and quality of ideas.
To converge, you have to measure.
Measure is the connection between ideas and reality.

In the divergent part you don't need the connection with the real world, but in the convergence you need expertise to measure how things are in reality.
*Use chatGPT for converging saying if it's good or not*

In ML, the prompt is called "one-shot learning".
