Desirability
Feasibility
Viability

Defining the problem is crucial for MEASURING.
If we focus only on the solution and not on the problem, we FUNNEL to much, not exploring.

Level of abstraction:  is the degree of generalization.

Technological Push and Market (or Need) Pull.

Is a niche too big or too small? Count the number of words to define the persona.

A divergence method is to negate one of the common attributes of the user.

2. a student needs reliable transport in order to attend be on time in classes at school /uni
	We believe that people commuting in italian public transport are not completely satisfied on the availability of the public transportation (not enough frequency, delays).
	
	So if we randomly send a back up (train, bus, etc) to continue the route on time, and then ask people about the service.
	
	Then more than x% of people will be satisfied.

4. a businessman needs higher quality alternatives to travel more comfortably and conveniently.
	We belive that cleaness and comfort in italian public transport is not currently what users desire.
	
	So if we randomly ask people on public transport apps about the cleaness and comfort in their last trip.
	
	Then more than x% of people will be dissatisfied.


1. a tourist needs to pay easily the bus in order to enjoy the trip without fines.
	We belive that payment information and methods are not enough for customers particularly for tourists.(making it hard for them and eventually allowing some of them to free ride because of lack of understanding.)Â 
	
	So if we put more information about how to use the public transport in the stops, in the stations, in the more touristic places, and in the aiports.
	
	Then more than x% of tourists will know how to use public transport and be prepared for the advantages and limitations

5. a person with lower income needs incentives based on income to use public transport more often
	We belive that many people would use public transport more if the ticket price was based on the isee.
	
	So if we ask people at the bus station (or on the app) to provide their isee in order to get discounts
	
	Then x% of people would get access to discounts and therefore use public transport more.


7. an environmentalist needs more sustainable options in public mobility in order not to harm environment with cars.
	We believe that environmentalist might be interested in more sustainable ways in and across cities.
	
	So if we pretend to have an electric car available for moving across cities and collect reservations for using it.
	
	Then more than x% will use this green transport vehicle to travel across cities.

How to be empathetic and use data?

SDGs are useful evaluation methods.
Design methods are hidden everywhere and are useful to look at reality differently.

Methods to identify users and need. (divergence)

IDENTIFY USERS
Methods for users
1. User Personas
2. Online surveys
3. Focus Groups
4. Interviews
5. Competitor analysis
Others
1. dictionary
2. chatGPT
3. Facebook (Social network analysis)

IDENTIFY NEEDS
Methods for needs.
Goal: Users' need statement.
1. Observation of behaviour of users. (like in Focus Group)
2. Writing need hypothesis (we believe that the user...so, if we... then we will see...)
3. self-reflection / brainstorming
4. Reviews and feedback analysis
5. 

ANALYSIS OF NEEDS


FAI-related methods
Identify users and needs
1. analyse website
3. Social network analysis (facebook)
	4. look at followers of FAI
4. Observation of behaviour of users
	1. at a FAI event/place
5. Interview board, workers and volunteers of the company
6. Ask workers and volunteers to fill a survey
7. Ask visitors to scan a QR code to fill a survey
		1. specifying users' data
		2. maybe get a discount
		3. where? QR code at the exit of events on  sheet of paper
		4. also send it to facebook follower of the page
8. Reviews and feedback analysis
potential users

TIDYING THINGS UP
Identifying users' needs.

1. Analysing website of FAI
	1. Reading informations, who they work with
	2. Examples: board, volunteers, schools, donors, ...
	3. **User Personas**: Create user personas based on the information gathered from the website. Develop profiles that represent the different types of users and stakeholders connected to FAI.

2. Social Network analysis
	1. Analyse follower and likes
	2. Posts with more likes, comments (needs), ...
	3. Facebook (likes), Instagram (customer profiles), X (B2B), Linkedin (workers)
	4. Explore the various places managed by FAI and read the reviews (facebook)

3. Benchmark
	1. Explore the website of other nations which successfully managed their museums, etc. (like UK and France).
	2. also to identify potential users not yet following FAI

5. Observation of users participating at events
	1. ask to fill a survey provided through a QR code

6. Interviews to stakeholders
	1. to workers, board (maybe), volunteers
	2. what kind of customers do they look for?

7. Writing need hypothesis (we believe that the user...so, if we... then we will see...) through self-reflection / brainstorming
