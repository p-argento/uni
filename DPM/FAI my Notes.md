# Notes on Methods for User'Need Analysis (slide)

Define the problem you want to solve before spending time and resources on generating possible solutions.

User Need Statement. 
Use verbs instead of nouns (which are used for solutions)

# 1. Identify users' groups
The goal is to have a list of potentially interesting users' needs, to measure them and to identify the most interesting to study in the design process.

The user is a real end-user segment.


# 2. Form a need hypothesis
The need can be a desire to improve current performance (potential) or to correct a deficiency (complaints).

A need hypothesis is an assumption to be tested.
(hypothesis driven design)

> So if we collect reservations for a Prototype Lunch Event (promoted to a representative sample of the target audience.)
> Then 15 of potential users will reserve a seat.




# 3. Experiment
