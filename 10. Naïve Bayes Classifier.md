[[DM Classification]]

It is a probabilistic framework for solving classification problems.

**Bayes Theorem**
The probability of getting the class variable $Y$,
given the attribute sets $X={X_1,X_2,...,X_d}$, is

**Bayes for classification**
By knowing the posterior probability P(Y|X) for every combination of X and Y, a test record X' can be classified by finding the class Y' that maximizes the posterior probability P(Y'|X').
And for the Bayes Theorem, this is equivalent of choosing the value of Y' that maximizes P(X'|Y')P(Y').
