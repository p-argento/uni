Ridge mitigates the problem of collinearity.
Lasso performs also variable selection.

*Multicollinearity*: is a phenomenon in which one predictor variable in a multiple regression model can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation, the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data.
