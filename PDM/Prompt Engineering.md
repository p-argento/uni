## SET OF LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR TODAY

- Deﬁne task goals
this skill refers to the ability to identify and establish clear objectives for a particular task or project. This involves breaking down complex or abstract ideas into speciﬁc, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, so that they can be tracked and evaluated;

- Use prompt language
this skill refers to the ability to effectively and efﬁciently communicate with generative AI models using language prompts or commands. This involves understanding the appropriate syntax, structure, and vocabulary to frame clear and unambiguous request for the AI model in order to let it generate accurate and relevant responses;

- Know the principles of generative AI
this knowledge refers to the understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles behind generative Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). The proper understanding of theories and models allows users to be aware of the real potential and the limitations of the automated generator . Under this premise users can properly set their expectations and interpret the results;

- Conduct performance measurement:
this skill refers to the ability to evaluate and analyse the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the AI model in achieving a given goal and objective. This involves outlining appropriate metrics or indicators to measure performance and comparing the model results against predetermined targets or benchmarks.

## CLASSES OF CHATGPT TASKS

- Generate Knowledge
This class involves tasks that require the creation or synthesis of new ideas, concepts, or content. It primarily focuses on producing original work or innovative solutions, often drawing from existing knowledge or information. Examples include writing poems, developing business ideas, creating marketing strategies, and designing lesson plans. These tasks often necessitate creative thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as an understanding of various domains and contexts.

- Measure Knowledge:
This class encompasses tasks that involve the analysis, evaluation, or quantiﬁcation of information or data. The primary objective is to extract insights, recognize patterns or themes, or assess the quality, relevance, or difﬁculty of a text or dataset. These tasks often rely on the application of various analytical techniques, critical thinking, and an understanding of the context in which the data or text is situated. Examples include sentiment analysis, text categorization, plagiarism detection, and source credibility evaluation.

- Translate Knowledge
This class covers tasks that involve converting, adapting, or recontextualizing information or content from one form, language, or level of complexity to another. The main goal is to make information more accessible, understandable, or suitable for a different audience or purpose. Examples include translating text between languages, simplifying complex concepts for a younger audience, paraphrasing text, and localizing website content. These tasks require linguistic and cultural understanding, as well as the ability to effectively communicate ideas and concepts in a new context or format.

#  Prompt Design

## WHO
Who = the receiver of the output of the task.
The Who is expressed by: the {Writer} of the prompt and the {Reader} of the textual output.
Examples of the {Writer} can be in the form: “I'm a student”, “I am a programmer”, or “I work as an engineer”. 
Examples of the {Reader}: “professor”, “my boss”, “a colleague”, or collective names such as “public”, or “a team”.
Also, the {Reader}, can be implicit, by deﬁning the typical person that communicates with him/her: for example, for having an output for students I can ask "act as a professor", to have an optimal output for a patient "I want you to talk as a doctor", for an output for the scientiﬁc community I can ask to "write as a researcher".

**PROGRAMMING CHAT GPT** • Sometimes you don’t just want an answer now, but you want to prepare chatGPT to give you answers over time

**EXPLAIN DEFINITION OF A CONCEPT**
Sometimes it is important to explain chatGPT what you intend with a concept.

*Deﬁnition of concept* = category of concept + differentiating characteristics

*Category* (genus)
This deﬁnes the category or class your concept ﬁts into. In essence, you are relating the term to its broader category so that your audience says “yeah, I know what those are”.

*Differentiating Characteristics* (differentia) These are the speciﬁc characteristics that set your term apart from other terms within that category. Once you’ve related your term to the broader category, now you are saying “well, it’s like those things, but with these differences.”


**USE OF EXAMPLES**
The examples can be entities (single instances of concepts) or sentences (concepts in contexts).
Must be as much different as possible since example diversity allows ChatGPT to deﬁne the directions of exploration of the space.
Quality is better than Quantity: so the more speciﬁc examples, the more complex/ tricky examples, the more different examples the higher is the abstraction ChatGPT can perform.
Having examples of inputs and outputs can help ChatGPT to mimic/adapt the output to the provided examples


## WRAP UP
