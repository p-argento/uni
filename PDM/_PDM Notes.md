**Project Notes**
[[FAI methods]]

**Professor's suggestions**
1. [Word Embedding and Word2Vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa)
2. Brainstorming types
3. always insert the prompt when using chatGPT (and which AI)
4. [[use AI in more innovative ways]]
5. the form is REALLY important (font, highlighting, images, tables, ecc)

**What do to**
1. asteriscs, and highlighting/bold/italics
2. cite and refer to tables and figures
3. explain which brainstorming type (2.1,2.3)
4. chatGPT prompt
	1. rafa social network
	2. tolgonai need identification ()
5. describe better the methods for
	1. user identification (chatGPT)
	2. need identification, add social comment method and ai-generated images
6. add more papers and references (give background to project)
	1. non-profit organization
	2. better method to define users?
7. reduce meaningless sentences in the report, adding further explanations on why things are important
8. use more mathematical formulas, maybe coming from papers
9. ask chatGPT if the project is fine based on professor's assessment table (innovative use of AI)

### Introduction

Desirability
Feasibility
Viability

Defining the problem is crucial for MEASURING.
If we focus only on the solution and not on the problem, we FUNNEL to much, not exploring.

Level of abstraction:  is the degree of generalization.

Technological Push and Market (or Need) Pull.

Is a niche too big or too small? Count the number of words to define the persona.

A divergence method is to negate one of the common attributes of the user.


### Random Stuff

SDGs are useful evaluation methods.
Don't stick to one level of abstraction.
And measure it.

**Importance of Measuring**
Using brainstorming you should measure the number and quality of ideas.
To converge, you have to measure.
Measure is the connection between ideas and reality.

In the divergent part you don't need the connection with the real world, but in the convergence you need expertise to measure how things are in reality.
*Use chatGPT for converging saying if it's good or not*

In ML, the prompt is called "one-shot learning".
