## Project
> Do not report a point to point matrix comparing 2 time series.
> Do not report simple distance calculations, they MUST be used to do something useful like clustering.

[[DM2 Project Notes]]

> minmax for clustering
> standard scaler for classification

NN.
Use sklearn. But try also PyTorch and Keras.
Relu for hidden layers and tanh or sigmoid for output layer.
