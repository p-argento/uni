## What are Motifs?
Fixed ONE long time series, we look for repeated patterns inside.
The question is: are there any repeated patterns of length m in the ts?
It is the corresponding of pattern mining, but for ts.

## Why Motifs?
They are used in
1. association rules
	1. discovery of primitive shapes and frequent patterns
2. ts classifiers
	1. constructing typical prototypes of each class made by motifs
3. ts anomaly detection
	1. detecting future patterns dissimilar to the model with typical shapes

## How to find Motifs?
Given a predefined motif length m, a *brute-force method* searches for motifs from all possible comparisons of subsequences.
It is obviously slow and computationally expensive.

From bio-informatics, there is a better algorithm based on *random projection*. Additionally, we know that SAX allows the use of lower bound discrete representation of ts.
See more in J Buhler and M Tompa. Finding motifs using random projections. In RECOMB'01. 2001.

## Motif Discovery with Random Projection
Assume that we have a ts T of length 1,000 and a motif of length 16, which occurs twice (time T1 and time T58).
We approximate the subsequence using SAX and we get a sequence of letters.s
Note that the motif length, the SAX window w and the alphabet are user-defined.

After the SAX approximation, we randomly choose a mask, hiding some of the letters obtained, and compare the values in the remaining columns with other strings.
The collisions are recorded by incrementing the appropriate location in the collision matrix.
At the end of the perturbations

## Matrix Profile
The Matrix Profile (MP) is a data structure that annotates a TS.
It can be exploited for many purposes, like efficient Motif Discovery.

Given a ts T and a desired subsequence length m.
We can use sliding window of length m to extract all subsequences of length m.
