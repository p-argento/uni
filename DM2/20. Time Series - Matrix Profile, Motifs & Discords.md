Inspired by Keogh Eamonn, the guru of ts.
## What are Motifs?
Fixed ONE long time series, we look for repeated patterns inside.
The question is: are there any repeated patterns of length m in the ts?
It is the corresponding of pattern mining, but for ts.

## Why Motifs?
They are used in
1. association rules
	1. discovery of primitive shapes and frequent patterns
2. ts classifiers
	1. constructing typical prototypes of each class made by motifs
3. ts anomaly detection
	1. detecting future patterns dissimilar to the model with typical shapes

## How to find Motifs?
Given a predefined motif length m, a *brute-force method* searches for motifs from all possible comparisons of subsequences.
It is obviously slow and computationally expensive.

From bio-informatics, there is a better algorithm based on *random projection*. Additionally, we know that SAX allows the use of lower bound discrete representation of ts.
See more in J Buhler and M Tompa. Finding motifs using random projections. In RECOMB'01. 2001.

## Motif Discovery with Random Projection
Assume that we have a ts T of length 1,000 and a motif of length 16, which occurs twice (time T1 and time T58).
We approximate the subsequence using SAX and we get a sequence of letters.s
Note that the motif length, the SAX window w and the alphabet are user-defined.

After the SAX approximation, we randomly choose a mask, hiding some of the letters obtained, and compare the values in the remaining columns with other strings.
The collisions are recorded by incrementing the appropriate location in the collision matrix.
At the end of the perturbations, it will be clear that the higher the number, the higher the chance of having a motif starting at those positions.

However, this approach is higly dependent from the approximation technique adopted. For this reason, the Matrix Profile was invented.

## Matrix Profile
The Matrix Profile (MP) is a data structure that annotates a TS.
It can be exploited for many purposes, like efficient Motif Discovery.

### MP Idea
Given a ts T and a desired subsequence length m.
We can use sliding window of length m to extract all subsequences of length m.
And compute the pairwise distance among subsequence.
To keep it simple, we can use ED, since we do not expect warping for such sort ts.

Then, for each subsequence, we store in a vector, called Matrix Profile (P), only the distance with the closest nearest neighbor.
In addition, we store in another vector, called Matrix Profile Index (I), the index of the corresponding nearest neighbor of each subsequence.

We can observe that the Matrix Profile representation looks like OPTICS.

### MP Observations
The MP index allows to find the nearest neighbor to any subsequence in constant time.
Note that the pointers in the matrix profiile are not necessarily symmetric.
The two smallest values in the MP must have the same value and their pointers must be mutual.

We can see that where the similarity is higher, the matrix profile has a valley.
If distances are low, it means that their subsequences have similar subsequences and therefore they are motifs.

### Read a MP
For relatively low values, you know that the subsequence in the original ts must have at least one relatively similar subsequence elsewhere in the data.
- These areas are the motifs
For relatively high data, you know that the subsequence in the original ts must be unique in its shape. 
- These areas are the anomalies, called TS Discords
