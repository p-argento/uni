## What are Motifs?
Fixed ONE long time series, we look for repeated patterns inside.
The question is: are there any repeated patterns of length m in the ts?
It is the corresponding of pattern mining, but for ts.

## Why Motifs?
They are used in
1. association rules
	1. discovery of primitive shapes and frequent patterns
2. ts classifiers
	1. constructing typical prototypes of each class made by motifs
3. ts anomaly detection
	1. detecting future patterns dissimilar to the model with typical shapes

## How to find Motifs?
Given a predefined motif length m, a *brute-force method* searches for motifs from all possible comparisons of subsequences.
It is obviously slow and computationally expensive.

From bio-informatics, there is a better algorithm based on *random projection*. Additionally, we know that SAX allows the use of lower bound discrete representation of ts.
See more in J Buhler and M Tompa. Finding motifs using random projections. In RECOMB'01. 2001.

We explore 2 methods
1. random projections
2. matrix profile

# 1. Motif Discovery with Random Projection
Assume that we have a ts T of length 1,000 and a motif of length 16, which occurs twice (time T1 and time T58).
We approximate the subsequence using SAX and we get a sequence of letters.
Note that the motif length, the SAX window w and the alphabet are user-defined.

After the SAX approximation, we randomly choose a mask, hiding some of the letters obtained, and compare the values in the remaining columns with other strings.
The collisions are recorded by incrementing the appropriate location in the collision matrix.
At the end of the perturbations, it will be clear that the higher the number, the higher the chance of having a motif starting at those positions.

However, this approach is higly dependent from the approximation technique adopted. For this reason, the Matrix Profile was invented.

# 2. Matrix Profile
The Matrix Profile (MP) is a data structure that annotates a TS.
It can be exploited for many purposes, like efficient Motif Discovery.

### MP Idea
Given a ts T and a desired subsequence length m.
We can use sliding window of length m to extract all subsequences of length m.
And compute the pairwise distance among subsequence.
To keep it simple, we can use ED, since we do not expect warping for such sort ts.

Then, for each subsequence, we store in a vector, called Matrix Profile (P), only the distance with the closest nearest neighbor.
In addition, we store in another vector, called Matrix Profile Index (I), the index of the corresponding nearest neighbor of each subsequence.

We can observe that the Matrix Profile representation looks like OPTICS.

### MP Observations
The MP index allows to find the nearest neighbor to any subsequence in constant time.
Note that the pointers in the matrix profiile are not necessarily symmetric.
The two smallest values in the MP must have the same value and their pointers must be mutual.

We can see that where the similarity is higher, the matrix profile has a valley.
If distances are low, it means that their subsequences have similar subsequences and therefore they are motifs.

### Read a MP
For relatively low values, you know that the subsequence in the original ts must have at least one relatively similar subsequence elsewhere in the data.
- These areas are the motifs
For relatively high data, you know that the subsequence in the original ts must be unique in its shape. 
- These areas are the anomalies, called TS Discords

### How to compute the Matrix Profile
Given a ts T and a desired subsequence length m.
0. we initialize the matrix profile (mp) as a "inf vector".
1. a subsequence Ti is randomly selected from T
2. we compute the distances between Ti and every other subsequence from T - O(|T|log(|T|)
3. we put the distances in a vector based on the position of the subsequence
4. we update the mp vector by applying the minimum  elementwise between the mp vector and the distance vector of each iteration (meaning that in the first iteration it is copied as it is)

![[Pasted image 20240422143049.png]]

Now, we randomly select another subsequence and repeat the process.
We repeat the two steps of distance computation and mp update for every subsequence.

A specific algo is used for the distance calculation, called Mueen's Algorithm for similarity search (MASS). [source](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/FastestSimilaritySearch.html)

Since there are |T| ts, the overall time complexity is $O(|T|^2log(|T|))$

## Motif Discovery from Matrix Profile
The valleys of the matrix profile are those that corresponds to local minimimus, meaning that they corresponds to motifs.
Note that we can identify only the distance with the closest neighbor (and the index).

![[Pasted image 20240422144301.png]]

## Example of MP

Each element of one row of the matrix is computed as the distance between a subsequence fixed for the row and all the other subsequences.


![[Pasted image 20240422154039.png]]

The MP vector is built from the minimum value of each row of the matrix above.

![[Pasted image 20240422154028.png]]

## Top-K Motifs (?)
It is possible to think of ts as points in a multidimensional space, even if this is not correct. In this way, dense regions correspond to regions where ts have a low corresponding value in the mp.

![[Pasted image 20240422145608.png|400]]

We can set a parameter R>1. For example R=2, meaning that we start from couples of motifs.
We find the distance D1 between the first pair of points with the lowest value in the mp.
We draw a circle of D1xR around those points, and if these include new points, they are considered motifs.
In this example, we found the Top-1 motif.

We can repeat this process until we reach the Top-K  motifs (where K is a hyperparameter).
We can use a predefined K or the Minimum Description Length (MDL) to stop.


??? not clear



## Anomaly Discovery from Matrix Profile
If instead of motifs we look for anomalies, we look for the max distance with all the other subsequences.

We begin by finding the subsequence with the highest distance in the MP. This corresponds to the biggest anomaly.

## Top-K Anomaly
In the Anomaly discovery, we can look for the E closest subsequence to the anomaly. Then we remove all of them.

## Using the MP for Clustering
(guidotti ideas not from slides)
The matrix profile alone is useless.
It can be used in a descriptive way to describe data.

It can also be used for clustering with TSKmeans, or for motifs.
For example, you can do clustering on small pieces and you will have clusters of motifs. I can represent a ts as a distance with a certain motif and then I will get a mp. Then you can put together ts closest to the same motif.
