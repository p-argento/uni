DM2 EXAM

Hi, this morning we made an agreement with prof. Guidotti to reopen the schedule system for the summer exams of Data Mining 2. He asked for a spreadsheet with the names and emails of those who are interested.

Writing your name on this list means that you will receive a link to book the slot (as for DM1). However, a week before the exams, all the bookings are confirmed and you must not change it, even if the website still allows it. Since there is your name on the list, Guidotti will know who will not respect this rule. If you cannot be there for important reasons, you can still contact him directly.

If you are not interested, you will only book on Valutami website. Then, you need to show up on the date indicated there and wait for your turn.

Remember that either way you must book on valutami.

The spreadsheet will be given to Guidotti on Monday 22, so consider Sunday night as the deadline to sign up.

Your representatives <3
