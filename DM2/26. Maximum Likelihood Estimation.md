## Intuition
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a method that determines values for the parameters of a model.
The parameter values are found such that they maximize the likelihood that the process described by the model produced the data that were actually observed.

Difference between likelihood and probability
1. probability
	1. is the area under the given probability distribution
	2. ie P(data|distribution)
2. likelihood
	1. is the y-axis value for fixed data point, changing the distribution

For example, we want to know what is the like

## Steps
Here the slides are again screenshots from statquest. So I'll watch the video.
