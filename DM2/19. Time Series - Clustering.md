# Approximation
## Why approximation
We represent the ts into a smaller and simpler space.
We loose some part of the data, but still remains understandable.
Approximation is a special form of dimensionality reduction specifically designed for TS.

The difference between approximation and compression is that
- approximation is still understandable
- compression may not be understandable

### Approximation example
We can decompose the data into many sine waves using the Fourier Transform.
The Fourier Coefficients are just a column of numbers.
Note that this is not reduced yet.

Now, we can truncate most of the small coefficients with little effect, leaving only the most significative waves.

### Types of TS Approximations

![[Pasted image 20240323174644.png]]

We have
1. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
2. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
3. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
4. Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA)
5. Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)
6. Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA)
7. Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX)

1-3 loose the temporal information.
4-7 keep the temporal information.
