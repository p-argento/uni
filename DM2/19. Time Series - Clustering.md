# Approximation
## Why approximation
We represent the ts into a smaller and simpler space.
We loose some part of the data, but still remains understandable.
Approximation is a special form of dimensionality reduction specifically designed for TS.

The difference between approximation and compression is that
- approximation is still understandable
- compression may not be understandable

### Approximation example
We can decompose the data into many sine waves using the Fourier Transform.
The Fourier Coefficients are just a column of numbers.
Note that this is not reduced yet.

Now, we can truncate most of the small coefficients with little effect, leaving only the most significative waves.

### TS Segmentation
Note that a ts can be segmented using
1. predefined length w
2. predefined number of segments k
3. change point detection methods

### Types of TS Approximations

![[Pasted image 20240323174644.png]]

We have
1. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
2. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
3. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
4. Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA)
5. Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)
6. Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA)
7. Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX)

1-3 loose the temporal information.
4-7 keep the temporal information.

## 1. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
It represents the ts as a a linear combination of sines and cosines.
Only N/2 coefficients are kept. In fact, sine waves requires two numbers, for the phase w and the amplitude A,B.
Low amplitude coefficients contribute little to information and can be discarded for saving storage space.
A ts represented with DTF is said to be in its frequency domain.

## 2. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
(NOT available in Python)

It represents the ts as a lineare combination of wavelet basis functions .
Keep only the first N coefficients.
Wavelets are represented data in terms of the sum and difference of a prototype function, called the "mother wavelet" or "analyzing wavelet".

While DFT captures a global representation, the DWT is localized in time. It means that some of the wavelet coefficients represent small local subsections of the data.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - good for stationarity signals | - ONLY defined if sequence length is an integral power of 2                                    |
| - fast linear time algo         | - in the wavelet, the left side of the signal is approximated at the expense of the right side |
|                                 | - do NOT support weighted distance measure                                                     |

## 3. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
(SKIP FOR NOW)



## 4. Piecewise Linear Approximation (PLA)
(NOT AVAILABLE IN PYTHON)

It represents the ts as a sequence of straight lines.
If lines are connected, then we have K/2 lines.
If lines are disconnected, then we have K/3.

There are many algos for segmenting ts.
How to choose the optimal number of segments K?
It is a tradeoff between accuracy and compactness with no general solution.

Each line segment can be represented with a pair of numbers:
1. length
2. left_height
	1. which is the starting point of the segment, while the right_height can be inferred by looking at the next segment

## 5. Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)
(MOST POPULAR)

It represents the ts as a sequence of box basis functions with each box of the same size.
It approximates a TS by dividing it into equal-length segments.
Then the mean value of the points in a segment is stored.
The vector of these values becomes the data reduced representation.

| - extremely fast                      |      |
| - supports NON-euclidean measures     |      |
| - support weighted Euclidean distance |      |

## 6. Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA)
(NOT available in Python)

It is a kind of mix between PLA and PAA.
It allows the segments to have arbitrary lengths, so two numbers for each segment are needed (the mean and the length).
It has the advantage of being able to place a single segment in an area of low activity and many segments in areas of high activity.
In addition, the structure of the data must be considered.

| -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| - fast linear time                     |      |
| - supports NON-euclidean measures      |      |
| - supports weighted euclidean distance |      |

## 7. Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX)

Basically, it takes PAA as a first step, and then approximates even more.
