# bpm2 - Business Processes
Introduction to Business Processes:  
Taylorism, work units, processes, terminology, organizational structures, process orientation and reengineering, visual notations_

Ch.1 of Workflow Management: Models, Methods, and Systems Ch.1 of Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures

Let's talk about terminology.
The topics are
1. process orientation
2. organizational structures
3. actors
4. cases and procedures


## Process Orientation
Products.
Products are the outcome of some work.
Products are supplied via markets.
There are services and products necessary for the organization.
People are organized in specialized work units.
There might be relatively autonomous divisions.

Process orientation is based on a critical analysis of a concept to organize work units. 
Originally introduced by Frederick Taylor. (!856-1915).
The aim of Taylorism is to improve industrial efficiency.
The management formulates detailed plans and communicate it to the workers.
Taylorism uses functional breakdown of complex work to small granularities.
Fine-grained activities require many handovers of work.

Pitfall of Taylorism.
The steps of a business process are often related to each other.
The handover of work can be a problem because in business organizations that process information the context information is required in every step and plain functional breakdown might be costly.
The complexity might prevent from seeing the overall schema.

Process Orientation serves to capture the activities a company performs, but also to improve the relationship between activities.
The process perspective is instrumental to combine multiple units of work of small granularity into work units of larger granularity to reduce the handover of work.

## Organizational Structures

An organizational structure establish how the work, authorities and responsabilities are divided amongst its staff. Meaning roles and functions.

The most relevant forms of organizational structure are
1. network structure
2. hierarchical structure
3. matrix structure
4.
