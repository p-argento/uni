process discovery, performance analysis


## intro, Event logs, 


## discovery, conformance, enhancement, perspectives, 



## play-in, play-out, replay, 
There are 3 strategies.


## overfitting, underfitting, 
Discovery and conformance: an example.



## alpha-algorithm, footprint matrix,
Process Discovery: $\alpha$-algorithm




## naive fitness, improved fitness, comparing footprints
Conformance checking: fitness measures.
