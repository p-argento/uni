# Orchestration vs Choreography
*Orchestration* is about INTRA-organization process.
No interaction with others.
The focus is on streamlining of internal processes, eliminating invaluable activities and allocating to the right people.
*Choreography* is about INTER-organization process.
B2B process.
The focus is on communication aspects and interoperability.

# Business Process Definition
> A business process consists of a set of activities that are performed in coordination in an organizational and technical environment.
> These activities jointly realize a business goal. Each business process is enacted by a single organization, but it may interact with business processes performed by other organizations. 
> - Weske

> business process management includes concepts, methods, and techniques to support the design, administration, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes.

Liveness = every transition can fire in the future.
dead = it will never fire

For places, a place is live if it can become unmarked.

Transition-live and place-live. Similar but not the same.
Transition-live implies place-live.
It is possible to draw a net that is place-live but not transition live.
If a transition does not appear in the coverability graph then it's dead.

Deadlock ???
