**Process**
1. We want to minimize the square of the distance between the observed values and the target line
2. We do this by taking the derivative of the sum of squared residuals and finding where it is equal to zero
3. The final line minimizes the sums of square (giving the least squares) between it and the real data.

**Key moment**
The idea is to find the minimum of the function that plots the sum of squared residual based on the slope the target function. The goal is finding the slope of the target function (and the intercept) so that the sum of squared residual is minimum. And this is done by computing the derivative of the sum of squared residuals.
