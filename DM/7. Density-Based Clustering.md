# DBSCAN
## Core, Border and Noise Points
DBSCAN is a density-based algorithm.
Density is the number of points within a specified radius (Eps)

Classification of points
1. core point
	1. if it has at least MinPts within the Eps (included the point)
2. border point
	1. if it is in the radius of a core point, but it is not a core point
3. noise point
	1. if it not a core point, not a border point

## Algorithm
Steps
1. visit each point
	1. if it is a core point and does not belong to a cluster
		1. create a cluster
	2. if it is a border point
		1. assign it to the cluster of the core point
	3. if it is a noise point
		1. ignore it

## Comments
DBSCAN is good because
- resist to noise
- can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes.
However, it does not work well with
- varying densities
- high dimensional data

## How to determine Eps and MinPts
How
1. Plot the sorted distance of every point to its k nearest neighbor
	1. the idea is that points in a cluster are roughly at the same distance, while noise points are at further distance
2. select MinPts and Eps close to the elbow, with appropriate distance for Eps and k for MinPts

# OPTICS
DBSCAN Evolution
## Description
OPTICS means Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure.
It produces a special order of the dataset based on the density-based clustering structure.
As with DBSCAN, only Eps and MinPts are required as parameters. See more details below about the Eps parameter.

However, an additional measure is used in the algorithm which is the *reachability distance* from a core point p to another core point q.
It is the max{core distance p , distance pq }
Where *core distance* (of a core point p) is the minimum radius (<Eps) required for classifying a given point as a core point, given MinPts.
In other words, if q is within the core distance of p, the reachability is the core distance, otherwise it is the real distance between p and q.

## Algorithm (not clear)
Steps
1. For each point p
	1. get the neighbours using Eps
	2. if p core point
		1. get to the closest point to p in terms of reachability
			1. calculate core distances
			2. for each neighbour q
			3. ...

OPTICS outputs the points in a particular order, annotated with their smallest reachability distance.

## Reachability Plot
It is the output of OPTICS. It is a special kind of dendrogram.
It allows to obtain the hierarchical structure of clusters.
On the x-axis, the points ordered as processed by OPTICS
On the y-axis, the reachability distance.

Points belonging to a cluster have a low reachability distance to their nearest neighbour.
The clusters show up as valleys in the reachability plot.
The deeper the valley, the denser the cluster.

## How to extract clusters
Different ways
1. select a range on the x-axis after visual inspection
2. select a threshold on the y-axis
3. use different algorithms to detect the valleys

## Is the Eps parameter necessary.?
It can be simply set to the maximum value possible.
In fact, using the core distance, OPTICS reduces the important of the eps parameter.
However, it can be used to cut off the density of clusters that are no longer interesting, speeding up the algorithm.

# HDBSCAN
DBSCAN Evolution
## Description
It converts DBSCAN into a hierarchical clustering algorithm, extracting however also a flat clustering.
It bypasses the choice of the Eps parameter, scanning all possible solutions with all values of Eps.
## Algorithm
Steps
1. Transform the Space, according to Mutual Reachability Distance
2. Build the Minimum Spanning Tree
3. Build the Cluster Hierarchy
4. Condense the Cluster Tree, based on minimum cluster size
5. Extract the Stable Clusters, from the condensed tree.

**1. Transform the Space, according to Mutual Reachability Distance**

The idea is to push sparse point away from the rest of the data before clustering.
We want to connect points that have low *Mutual Reachability Distance*.
This means that they should be
- close enough to each other -> $d(x_i,x_j)$
- (or) in a dense enough region -> $core\_distance_k(x_i)$
Meaning that the Mutual Reachability Distance is
$$d\_mutual\_reachability(x_i,s_j)=max (d\_core(x_i),d\_core(x_j),d(x_i,x_j))$$

**2. Build the Minimum Spanning Tree**

Here the goal is preparing data for clustering using $d\_mutual\_reach$.
We build a graph that connects all points, weighted by $d\_mutual\_reach$.
Then we start disconnecting points by lowering the threshold.
Among $n^2$ possible edges point, we identify the threshold using the *Minimum Spanning Tree*, such that there is no lower weight edge that could connect the components.

How to build the Minimum Spanning Tree?
Using Prim's Algorithm. It builds the tree one edge at a time, always adding the lowest weight edge that connects the current tree to a vertex not yet in the tree.

**3. Build the Cluster Hierarchy**

Given the minimal spanning tree, the next step is to convert it into the hierarchy of connected components.
How to do it?
Sort the edges of the tree by distance in increasing order.
Then iterate creating a new merged cluster for each edge, using *single linkage hierarchical* clustering algorithm.

**4. Condense the Cluster Tree, based on minimum cluster size**

Condense the large and complicated hierarchy into a smaller tree.
How?
Use the *Minimum Cluster Size*, which is a parameter.
Walk through the hierarchy top-down and compare each new cluster with the Minimum Cluster Size.

**5. Extract the Stable Clusters, from the condensed tree.**

In the end, we choose clusters that persist and have a longer lifetime.
We look for *Stable Clusters* beacause short clusters are probably artifacts of single linkage.
Looking at the plot, we select clusters with the greatest area.
If we select a cluster, then we cannot select any cluster that is descendant of it.

# Additional Notes
*dbscan exercises*
Typically the default value of minPoints = 4, but we use 3.
Place the yellow point into a dot.
1. divide core point, border point and noise point.
2. core point. in the eps distance there are minPoints (included the point) -> the area is dense enough
3. border points are in the neighbourhood of a core point (but are not core points)
4. noise, everything else.

Labeling procedure.
1. start from one core point and colour within the eps
2. go further to find another core point (skip border points)
