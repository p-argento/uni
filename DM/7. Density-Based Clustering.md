# DBSCAN
## Core, Border and Noise Points
DBSCAN is a density-based algorithm.
Density is the number of points within a specified radius (Eps)

Classification of points
1. core point
	1. if it has at least MinPts within the Eps (included the point)
2. border point
	1. if it is in the radius of a core point, but it is not a core point
3. noise point
	1. if it not a core point, not a border point

## Algorithm
First eliminate noise points, then

## Comments
DBSCAN is good because
- resist to noise
- can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes.
However, it does not work well with
- varying densities
- high dimensional data

## How to determine Eps and MinPts
How
1. Plot the sorted distance of every point to its k nearest neighbor
	1. the idea is that points in a cluster are roughly at the same distance, while noise points are at further distance
2. select MinPts and Eps close to the elbow, with appropriate distance for Eps and k for MinPts
