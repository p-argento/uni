# DBSCAN
## Core, Border and Noise Points
DBSCAN is a density-based algorithm.
Density is the number of points within a specified radius (Eps)

Classification of points
1. core point
	1. if it has at least MinPts within the Eps (included the point)
2. border point
	1. if it is in the radius of a core point, but it is not a core point
3. noise point
	1. if it not a core point, not a border point

## Algorithm
Steps
1. visit each point
	1. if it is a core point and does not belong to a cluster
		1. create a cluster
	2. if it is a border point
		1. assign it to the cluster of the core point
	3. if it is a noise point
		1. ignore it

## Comments
DBSCAN is good because
- resist to noise
- can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes.
However, it does not work well with
- varying densities
- high dimensional data

## How to determine Eps and MinPts
How
1. Plot the sorted distance of every point to its k nearest neighbor
	1. the idea is that points in a cluster are roughly at the same distance, while noise points are at further distance
2. select MinPts and Eps close to the elbow, with appropriate distance for Eps and k for MinPts



# OPTICS
DBSCAN Evolution
## Description
OPTICS means Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure.
It produces a special order of the dataset based on the density-based clustering structure.
As with DBSCAN, only Eps and MinPts are required as parameters. See more details below about the Eps parameter.

However, an additional measure is used in the algorithm which is the *reachability distance* from a core point p to another core point q.
It is the max{core distance p , distance pq }
Where *core distance* (of a core point p) is the minimum radius (<Eps) required for classifying a given point as a core point, given MinPts.
In other words, if q is within the core distance of p, the reachability is the core distance, otherwise it is the real distance between p and q.

## Algorithm (not clear)
Steps
1. For each point p
	1. get the neighbours using Eps
	2. if p core point
		1. get to the closest point to p in terms of reachability
			1. calculate core distances
			2. for each neighbour q
			3. ...

OPTICS outputs the points in a particular order, annotated with their smallest reachability distance.

## Reachability Plot
It is the output of OPTICS. It is a special kind of dendrogram.
It allows to obtain the hierarchical structure of clusters.
On the x-axis, the points ordered as processed by OPTICS
On the y-axis, the reachability distance.

Points belonging to a cluster have a low reachability distance to their nearest neighbour.
The clusters show up as valleys in the reachability plot.
The deeper the valley, the denser the cluster.

## How to extract clusters
Different ways
1. select a range on the x-axis after visual inspection
2. select a threshold on the y-axis
3. use different algorithms to detect the valleys

## Is the Eps parameter necessary?
It can be simply set to the maximum value possible.
In fact, using the core distance, OPTICS reduces the important of the eps parameter.

# HDBSCAN
DBSCAN Evolution
## Description
It converts DBSCAN into a hierarchical clustering algorithm, extracting however also a flat clustering.
It bypasses the choice of the Eps parameter, scanning all possible solutions with all values of Eps.
## Algorithm
Steps
1. Transform the Space, according to Mutual Reachability Distance
2. Build the Minimum Spanning Tree
3. Build the Cluster Hierarchy
4. Condense the Cluster Tree, based on minimum cluster size
5. Extract the Stable Clusters, from the condensed tree.
