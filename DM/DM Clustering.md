Unsupervised Learning.
The goal is to partition the dataset into subgroups (clusters) so that the points within the same cluster are more similar than the ones in the others.

# Data Similarity
How
- euclidean distance
- manhattan distance
- cosine similarity

### Minkowski distance
![[Pasted image 20231107155238.png|200]]
It is a generalization of euclidean. Uses the abs instead of square.

*Euclidean distance* (r=2)

Standardisation is necessary.

*Manhattan distance* (r=1)

### Similarity between binary data
How
- Simple Matching (SMC)
- Jaccard Coefficients

### Correlation
