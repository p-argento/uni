## What is Data?
Data is a collection of data objects (called records) and their attributes (or variables).
*Document Data* -> Each document becomes a vector made by the frequency of each word (that becomes the attributes).
*Transaction Data* -> Each record is a transaction that includes a set of items.
## Types of attributes
There are 5 types
- Nominal / Categorical
	- names, IDs, ..
- Binary
	- Symmetric -> outcomes equally important (male/female)
	- Asymmetric -> not equally important (positive/negative)
- Ordinal
	- short/medium/tall
- Numeric
	- equal-sized units, dates, temperature
- Ratio-scaled
	- ? what

Then
- Discrete
- Continuous

## Data Quality
Issues
1. Syntactic Accuracy -> text in numbers or misspelling
2. Semantic Accuracy -> incorrect data
3. Completeness -> missing values
4. Unbalanced Data -> biased data
5. Timeliness -> is the data up to date?

How to discover quality issues? With descriptive statistics.
Observe data distributions. They can be:
- Unimodal
- Bimodal
- Positively Skewed (like income)
- Negatively Skewed

For categorical attributes? Bar Charts to represent frequencies of the values.
For numerical attributes? Histograms to represent frequencies of bins.

How to calculate the **number of bins**?
Using Sturges's Rule $k=log_2(n)+1$ where $n$ is the sample size.

## Measuring Central Tendency
Common measures are
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
## Measuring Dispersion (or variance)
Common measures are

1. range
	1. distance between biggest and smallest

2. standard deviation
	1. variance
	2. standard deviation
	3. absolute average deviation
	4. median average deviation -> the median (instead of mean) of all deviations from the mean

3. five-number summary (based on quartiles)


4. inter-quartile range


## Visualization

Histograms


Scatterplots


Parallel Coordinates


Matrix Plots

## Correlation Analysis
The correlation measures the linear relationship between objects, capturing the similar behaviour of two variables.

## Outliers



## Missing Values




## Checklist for Data Understanding
Checklist for Data Understanding
• Determine the quality of the data. (e.g. syntactic accuracy)
• Find outliers. (e.g. using visualization techniques) 
• Detect and examine missing values. Possible hidden by default values. 
• Discover new or confirm expected dependencies or correlations between attributes. 
• Check specific application dependent assumptions (e.g. the attribute follows a normal distribution) 
• Compare statistics with the expected behaviour.
