## What is Data?
Data is a collection of data objects (called records) and their attributes (or variables).
*Document Data* -> Each document becomes a vector made by the frequency of each word (that becomes the attributes).
*Transaction Data* -> Each record is a transaction that includes a set of items.
## Types of attributes
There are 5 types
- Nominal / Categorical
	- names, IDs, ..
- Binary
	- Symmetric -> outcomes equally important (male/female)
	- Asymmetric -> not equally important (positive/negative)
- Ordinal
	- short/medium/tall
- Numeric
	- equal-sized units, dates, temperature
- Ratio-scaled
	- ? what

Then
- Discrete
- Continuous

## Data Quality
Issues
1. Syntactic Accuracy -> text in numbers or misspelling
2. Semantic Accuracy -> incorrect data
3. Completeness -> missing values
4. Unbalanced Data -> biased data
5. Timeliness -> is the data up to date?

How to discover quality issues? With descriptive statistics.
Observe data distributions. They can be:
- Unimodal
- Bimodal
- Positively Skewed (like income)
- Negatively Skewed

For categorical attributes? Bar Charts to represent frequencies of the values.
For numerical attributes? Histograms to represent frequencies of bins.

How to calculate the **number of bins**?
Using Sturges's Rule $k=log_2(n)+1$ where $n$ is the sample size.

## Measuring Central Tendency
Common measures are
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
## Measuring Dispersion (or variance)
Common measures are

1. range
	1. distance between biggest and smallest

2. standard deviation
	1. variance
	2. standard deviation
	3. absolute average deviation
	4. median average deviation -> the median (instead of mean) of all deviations from the mean

3. five-number summary (based on quartiles)
	1. they are min, Q1, median, Q3, max
	2. it is represented with a boxplot that includes
		1. InterQuartileRange = Q3-Q1
		2. Median = Q2
		3. Whiskers -> range from Q1-1.5\*IQR to Q3+1.5\*IQR
	3. Outliers are outside whiskers

## Visualization

Boxplots
(see above)

**Histograms**.
Better than boxplots for visualizing distributions.
![[Pasted image 20240108184415.png|400]]

**Scatterplots**.
For bivariate (two variables) data. Helpful for correlation, clusters, outliers.
Advanced scatterplots can include a third variable using colors or simbols.
A matrix of scatterplots can be used to visualize all pairs of combinations of variables.

**Matrix Plots**
Plot the data matrix. Similarity or distance matrix can also be useful.
It is important to normalize attributes to prevent domination of some.

**Parallel Coordinates.**
Used to plot values of high-dimensional data.
Each object is represented as a line and the attribute value is plotted on the corresponding column.
The order of attributes in the representation is crucial.

**Radar Plots.**
Similar to parallel coordinates, but axis meet at the center and radiates to form a polygon.
![[Pasted image 20240108184543.png|400]]

**Star Plots.**
Same as radar plots, but each data object (or record) is drawn separately.

## Correlation Analysis
The correlation measures the linear relationship between objects, capturing the similar behaviour of two variables.

 **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**
 It is a measure of the linear relationship between 
 ![[Pasted image 20240108185208.png|400]]
where $s_i$ are std dev.
The larger the stronger the relationship.

**Spearman Correlation Coefficient**
Another correlation coefficient is Spearman’s correlation that works by calculating Pearson’s correlation on the ranked values of this data. Ranking (from low to high) is obtained by assigning a rank of 1 to the lowest value, 2 to the next lowest and so on. Then plot the ranked data, with rank of x on the x-axis and rank of y on the y-axis.
## Outliers
They are data objects (record) with considerably different characteristics than other objects.
They can be
- noise that interfere with the analysis
- target of the analysis (like card fraud)

**How to detect outliers**
Methods
- Categorical attributes -> extremely lower frequency
- numerical attributes -> use box plots
- multidimensional attribute
	- detect visually -> using scatterplots or PCA
	- cluster analysis -> outliers if cannot be assigned

## Missing Values
Many reasons for missing values.
Zero or default can be missing values.

## Checklist for Data Understanding
Checklist for Data Understanding
• Determine the quality of the data. (e.g. syntactic accuracy)
• Find outliers. (e.g. using visualization techniques) 
• Detect and examine missing values. Possible hidden by default values. 
• Discover new or confirm expected dependencies or correlations between attributes. 
• Check specific application dependent assumptions (e.g. the attribute follows a normal distribution) 
• Compare statistics with the expected behaviour.
