## Data Understanding vs Data Preparation
| **Data Understanding** | **Data Preparation** |
| -- | -- |
| existence of missing values | select attributes |
| existence of outliers | reduce data dimension |
| character of attributes | select records |
| dependencies between attributes | treat missing values |
|  | treat outliers |
|  | integrate, unify and transform data |
|  | improve data quality |
## Data Preparation Checklist
1. Aggregation
2. Data Reduction (Sampling)
3. Dimensionality Reduction
4. Feature Subset Selection
5. Feature Creation
6. Discretization and Binarization
7. Attribute Transformation

## 1. Aggregation
Combining more attributes into one.
Why?
- Dimensionality reduction
- Change of scale (from seconds to minutes)
- Less variability (aggregated data is less variable)

## 2. Data Reduction
Reducing number of records
- sampling
- clustering
Reducing number of attributes
- selection of attributes subset
- generation of new set of attributes

**Sampling**
Must be representative of the dataset
Improve the processing time required.

Types of sampling
- simple random sampling (equal probability)
	- with replacement
	- without replacement
- stratified sampling (better)
	- draw random samples from partitions to keep structure

**Feature Selection**
Choose a subset that is as small as possible.
Remove features that are:
- irrelevant
- redundant

## 3. Dimensionality Reduction

**Curse of Dimensionality**
When dimensionality increases, data becomes increasingly sparse.
Then, density and distance between points become less meaningful.
And therefore, clustering and classifiers are less effective.

**Techniques for dimensionality reduction**
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
3. Other supervised and non-linear techniques

## 4. Feature Selection

**Type of Methods for feature selection
1. Filter Methods
	1.  independently of dm task, selection after analyzing the significance and correlation with other attributes
2. Wrapper Methods
	1. incremental selection of best attributes based on dm task performance
3. Embedded Methods
	1. selection is part of the dm algorithm, which choose most useful attributes (decision tree)

**Focus on Wrapper Methods**
