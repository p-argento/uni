Supervised learning refers to problem where the value of a target should be predicted based on the values of other attributes.
Problems with a categorical target attribute are called *classification*.
Problems with a numerical target attribute are called *regression*.

Classification consists in learning a model/function f that maps each attribute set x into one of the predefined class labels y -> $f(x) = y$
The learning is performed on a given collection of records named *training set*.
Each record is characterized by a tuple $(x,y)$.
$x$ -> attribute, predictor, indipendent variable, input
$y$ -> class, response, dependent variable, output

The *goal* is to assign previously unseen records to a class.
A *test set* is used to determine the accuracy of the model.
