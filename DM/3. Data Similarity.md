## Euclidean distance
![[Pasted image 20231107154548.png|200]]
Standardisation is necessary.

## Manhattan Distance (city block)
...

## Minkowski Distance
It is a generalization of euclidean. Uses the abs instead of square.

Particular types of Minkowsky Distance
- euclidean distance
- manhattan distance

## Distance Matrix
(or proximity matrix). Clearly symmetric, because the distance xy=yx.


## Properties of similarity vs distance
| Distance | Similarity |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1. d(x, y) >= 0 for all x and y and d(x, y) = 0 only if x = y. (Positive definiteness) <br>2. d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x and y. (Symmetry)<br>3. d(x, z) <= d(x, y) + d(y, z) for all points x, y, and z. (Triangle Inequality) | 1. s(x, y) = 1 (or maximum similarity) only if x = y. (does not always hold, e.g., cosine)<br>2. s(x, y) = s(y, x) for all x and y. (Symmetry) |
Remeber that distance = dissimilarity


## Similarity between binary data

- Simple Matching (SMC)
- Jaccard Coefficients
