# Data Similarity
How
- euclidean distance
- manhattan distance
- cosine similarity

### Minkowski distance
![[Pasted image 20231107155238.png|200]]
It is a generalization of euclidean. Uses the abs instead of square.

*Euclidean distance* (r=2)

Standardisation is necessary.

*Manhattan distance* (r=1)
