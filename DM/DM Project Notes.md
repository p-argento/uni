# PCA

In my lecture notes, the PCA should be done AFTER clustering not to loose information. In fact, the clustering should be done on all attributes.

Whether you should perform clustering or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) first depends on the goal of your analysis and the nature of your data.

- **Clustering**: If your primary objective is to identify and group similar data points together, perhaps to discover patterns or relationships within the data, starting with clustering might be beneficial. Clustering helps in identifying natural groupings within the dataset, allowing you to understand the inherent structure or relationships among the data points.

- **PCA**: On the other hand, if your aim is to reduce the dimensionality of the data and capture the most significant variability within the dataset, PCA could be a good starting point. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables (principal components) that retain the most important information of the dataset.

Here are a few considerations:

1. **Clustering after PCA**: If you have a high-dimensional dataset and want to both reduce dimensionality and identify clusters within the data, you might consider applying PCA first to reduce the number of features and then perform clustering on the reduced dataset. This can sometimes make the clustering process more efficient and could reveal clusters that might not have been easily noticeable in the original high-dimensional space.

2. **PCA after Clustering**: If your primary goal is to understand the data structure through clustering and then later comprehend the relationships among the clusters by reducing the dimensionality, you might choose to perform PCA after clustering. This could help you explore the principal components within each identified cluster separately, gaining insights about the most important features contributing to the variation within those clusters.

Ultimately, the decision to apply clustering or PCA first depends on the specific objectives of your analysis and the nature of the dataset. It might also be valuable to experiment with both approaches to see which order yields more meaningful and interpretable results for your particular use case.
