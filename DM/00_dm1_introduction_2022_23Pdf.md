# Intro

>[!cite|#ffd400]+ Notes [(p. 13)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEQNLTWC?page=13&annotation=TZJNUESF)
>To apply a statistical model you need to know what you're looking for. There must be a question. In DM you're looking for questions. It's not simply validating an hypotesis.
We are looking for methodologies to extract information from data.

>People activities leave digital traces. This is a crucial difference between analog and digital society

>We don't care of the individual pattern. We're looking for the pattern of many. Individual data may be sensitive, be aware of gdpr.

> It is very unlikely to go straight. Try to apply different methods and algorithms.

> In the first stage you talk with data engineer or computer scientist, technical people who manage date. In the end, there are stakeholders like manager, policy maker, who need to understand data.

# Predictive and Descriptive Methods

> [!cite|#ffd400]+ Highlight [(p.31)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEQNLTWC?page=31&annotation=9KDYX44F))
> *" • Predictive Methods
> Use some variables to predict unknown or future values of other variables. "*
> Like ML
>


> [!cite|#ffd400]+ Highlight [(p.31)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEQNLTWC?page=31&annotation=EKJFP6T2))
> *" • Descriptive Methods • Find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data. "*
> Pattern recognition, so unsupervised


# Data Mining Tasks: Classification, Clustering and Association Rule

> [!cite|#ffd400]+ Highlight [(p.33)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEQNLTWC?page=33&annotation=SKCTDSNT))
> *" Classification "*
> Finding a function that can assign a label to new data from a database where the label (class) is known.
>


> [!cite|#ffd400]+ Highlight [(p.39)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEQNLTWC?page=39&annotation=5FUNJDWY))
> *" Clustering "*
> Finding groups of similar objects. Moving from individuals to groups of people.
>

> ![[_Media/image-39-x211-y6.png]]
> Clustering

>


> [!cite|#ffd400]+ Highlight [(p.44)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XEQNLTWC?page=44&annotation=7W5HH3GG))
> *" Association Rule Discovery "*
> Basically pattern recognition. Like the "beer and diaper" story. Examples are Market Basket Analysis and understanding diseases from genetic point of view.
