# Cluster Analysis
## What is Clustering
A clustering is a set of clusters.
What is NOT clustering?
- NOT Simple Segmentation (like dividing alphabetically)
- NOT the result of a query
- NOT class label information (supervised learning),..

Two main ideas.
1. Intra-cluster distances are minimized
2. Inter-clusters are maximized

Applications of Cluster Analysis
1. Understanding
2. Summarization

## Types of clustering set
Main Types
- **Partitional Clustering** -> non-overlapping clustering
- **Hierarchical Clustering** -> nested clusters (dendrogram)

Other distinctions between sets of clusters
1. exclusive vs non-exclusive
2. fuzzy vs non-fuzzy
	1. a point belongs to a cluster with some weights between 0 and 1 (total=1)
3. partial vs complete
	1. cluster only some data
4. heterogenous vs homogenous
## Types of clusters
Main types
- center-based
	- an object is closer to the centroid of the cluster than any other centroid
	- the centroid is the average of all points in the cluster
- contiguity-based (nearest neighbour)
	- ? each point is closer to at least one point in its cluster than to any point in another cluster
	- have trouble with noise
- density-based
	- cluster is a dense region of points
	- better for outliers or irregular shapes
-  defined by objective function
	- minimize or maximize the objective function
	- typically hierarchical algorithms has local objective, while partitional algorithms have global objectives
Other types
- well-separated
	- if every point is closer to every other point in the cluster than to other points not in the cluster
- property or conceptual
# Cluster validity
## How to validate Clusters
To compare clustering algorithms results.

Why to evaluate?
1. avoid finding patterns in noise
2. compare clustering algorithms
3. compare two sets of clusters
4. compare two clusters

Determine the correct number of clusters.

## Measure of Cluster Validity
Criteria:
- external index
	- to measure the extent to which cluster labels match externally supplied class labels
	- ie entropy
- internal index
	- without external information
	- ie sse, cohesion and separation, silhouette
- relative index
	- to compare different clusters
## Measuring cluster validity using the Similarity Matrix
Compute the correlation between the similarity matrix and the ideal similarity matrix.
 In the ideal similarity matrix -> 1 belongs / 0 not
High correlation indicates that points that belong to the same cluster are close to each other.

## Internal measure: SSE
Internal Index: Used to measure the goodness of a clustering structure without respect to external information


- cohesion -> SS within a cluster
	- cluster cohesion is the sum of weights of all links within a cluster
- separation -> SS between clusters 
	- cluster separation is the sum of weights between nodes in the cluster and outside
- silhouette coefficient
	- given a point in a cluster, s = (minAvgExt â€“ avgWithin) / max(avgs)
Interpretation
- statistics as a framework
	- more atypical index value means more likely to represent data
	- look at the position on the histogram

## Internal Measure: Cohesion and Separation




## Internal Measure: Silhouette Coefficient
