# Cluster Analysis
## What is Clustering
A clustering is a set of clusters.
What is NOT clustering?
- NOT Simple Segmentation (like dividing alphabetically)
- NOT the result of a query
- NOT class label information (supervised learning),..

Two main ideas.
1. Intra-cluster distances are minimized
2. Inter-clusters are maximized

## Applications of Cluster Analysis


## Types of clustering set
- Partitional -> exclusive
- Hierarchical -> nested clusters (dendrogram)
## Types of clusters
- center-based -> centroid
- contiguity-based -> nearest neighbour (trouble with noise)
- density-based -> dense cluster (better for outliers)
- objective function -> minimize or max the obj function
# Cluster validity
## How to validate Clusters
To compare clustering algorithms results.
Determine the correct number of clusters.
Criteria:
- external labels
- internal measure (sse)
- compare clusters.


Measure correlation:
- distance (or similarity) matrix (NOT good for contiguity or db)
- ideal similarity matrix -> 1 belongs / 0 not
## Internal measure
- cohesion -> SS within a cluster
	- cluster cohesion is the sum of weights of all links within a cluster
- separation -> SS between clusters 
	- cluster separation is the sum of weights between nodes in the cluster and outside
- silhouette coefficient
	- given a point in a cluster, s = (minAvgExt â€“ avgWithin) / max(avgs)
Interpretation
- statistics as a framework
	- more atypical index value means more likely to represent data
	- look at the position on the histogram
