(00:00) tensorflow an open source machine learning framework famous for powering deep neural networks with high-level code it was developed by the google brain team and first released in 2015. it's most commonly used with python but can run in other languages like javascript c plus plus and java at its core it's just a library for programming with linear algebra and statistics as you know the word tensor describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects within a vector space aka a multi-dimensional array what makes
(00:29) it special is its collection of apis for data processing visualization model evaluation and deployment that make deep learning accessible to the average developer it's extremely portable and is able to run on tiny mobile cpus or microcontrollers with tensorflow lite can run in the browser with tensorflow.
(00:47) js while the core library can scale up to multiple gpus or run on tensor processing units ships engineered specifically to run tensorflow at a massive scale it's used in medicine for object detection and mri images by twitter to sort your timeline by tweet relevance by spotify to recommend music by paypal for fraud detection in addition to many other applications like self-driving cars natural language processing and so on to build your own neural network right now create a python file and install tensorflow next we'll need some data like fashion mnist which
(01:16) we can automatically import the goal is to train a model that can predict the clothing type of each image tensorflow has a subclassing api for expert users but also integrates with the beginner-friendly keras library which has a sequential api that can easily build neural networks layer by layer we start with a flattened layer that takes the 28 by 28 pixel image as an input and converts it into a one-dimensional array this input layer is then fed into a dense layer with 128 fully connected neurons or nodes you can think of each
(01:44) node like its own linear regression as each data point flows through it it'll try to guess the output and gradually update a mapping of weights to determine the importance of a given variable in this case it uses a rectified linear activation function that will output the input if a certain threshold is met otherwise it will just output zero and the behavior of this layer can be customized by tuning as hyperparameters finally we have our output layer which is also dense but is limited to 10 nodes which corresponds to the total number of
(02:11) clothing types in the data set now we can compile the model and tell it to optimize a certain loss function like sparse categorical cross entropy as we train the model for multiple epochs its accuracy should gradually improve the end result is a model that makes a prediction with the likelihood that an image is a certain type of clothing congratulations you just built a neural network this has been tensorflow in 100 seconds hit the like button if you want to see more short videos like this thanks for watching and i will see you
