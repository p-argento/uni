# Intro
---
We we'll use SVM with RBF Kernel.
The dataset is ["default of credit card clients"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients) from UCI ML Repo.

SVM are one of the best ML methods when getting the correct answer is the priority, rather than understanding why we get that answer.

Steps
1. importing data
2. missing data
3. downsampling data
4. formatting data for svm
5. building a preliminary svm
6. optimize parameters with cross-validation
7. building, evaluating, drawing and interpreting the SVM

Comment.
They are great 'out of the box' and then optimize them doesn't give a huge bonus (like classification trees).
