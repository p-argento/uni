*outline*
1. Difference between Parallel and Distributed Computing
2. The typical Distributed computing issues
3. What is Hadoop
4. How Map-Reduce works
5. How HDFS works
6. Limitations of Hadoop
7. The main difference between Hadoop and Spark

The 3 issues of Distributed Computing are
1. Communication
	1. process of exchanging data between different parts of a system
2. Synchronization
	1. meaning coordination of processes
3. Fault Tolerance
	1. ability of a system to continue operating correctly in the event of failure of one or more of its components, preventing complete system failure
