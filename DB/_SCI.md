Strategic and Competitive Intelligence
Filippo Chiarello

## Intelligence
Competitive Intelligence (or Corporate Intelligence or CI) involves gathering and analyzing information about your competitors, target customers and market.
Data enables to make contextual, data-led decisions.
The ultimate goal is to establish or enhance *competitive advantage*.

What is competitive advantage?
As students, a competitive advantage can be related to getting better positions than other students.
Needs are getting more complex.

Today, the amount of information is too much.
But we have tools.

## Intelligence Types
Types
1. HUM-INT (Human Intelligence)
	1. having a good network is the best way to avoid undercover operations
	2. go to the bar where employees of your dream company go
2. SIG-INT (Signal Intelligence)
	1. intercept calls, emails,..
3. GEO-INT (Geospatial Intelligence)
	1. satellite images, ...
4. MAS-INT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence)
5. OS-INT (*Open Source Intelligence*)
	1. sources that are not protected and can be accessed in a legal way
	2. it is a recent practice

### Open Source Intelligence
1. Definition: Intelligence collected from publicly available sources.
2. Sources: Newspapers, journals, radio, television, websites, and social media platforms.
3. Applications: Gathering information that is available in the public domain, often used for research, situation analysis, and decision-making support.

The goal is to collect knowledge to make decision, not to get more knowledge like researchers.

## Course Structure
Steps
1. Plan
	1. not user anymore, but a customer (boss, company or professor)
	2. define expectational needs of the customer
	3. each group will act as consultant helping customer to start a company in a certain field
2. Gather
	1. most important and intense activity
	2. gather and EVALUATE, is the information solid? can I trust it? is it first hand or second hand information?
	3. gathering means also understanding data
3. Analyze
	1. the goal is making knowledge from data
	2. using the right tools to make knowledge is hard
	3. text mining and NLP are the main tools because most of the intelligence data is unstructured data in text format
4. Interpret
	1. make an informational output
	2. like a dashboard, a report, a business plan, a chart, presentation

Give a Presentation and prepare a Dashboard.
Think as a data scientist. The goal must be accessible for the customer.
Groups up to 3-4 people.

If a problem is not solvable, probably there is something wrong in the plan, in framing the problem
