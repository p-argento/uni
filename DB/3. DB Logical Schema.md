## Logical Design

A table is a set of lines (or records).
It has a name and a set of column names (or fields or attributes).
A type is also defined for each attributes.
There can be constraints. Like a salary must be positive.

The key constraint, where every line of an attribute must be unique. There could many key constraint.
A foreign key constraint is also called an inclusion constraint (or subset constraint). It means that every value that appears in the column must appear in the column connected. It is a relation of subset $A\subseteq B$.
The foreign key looks like an association in concept design. But here I use a value to represent the association.

Every relation has
- extensional aspect, the content of the table, the rows
- schema, descriptional aspects
I always build a database in the sequence
1. build the schema
2. fill with content

The content of a table is a set of lines.
The order is irrelevant.
Usually a define at least one key constraint, to avoid repetition of rows.
The extension of a table is a set, not a multiset.
The notation is very similar to conceptual schema.
Now the arrow is just one. An arrow does not denote an association, but a foreign key, that is just an attribute.
The primary key is underlined. And I put a star next to the primary key.

I can have a ciclic association. It will just be a foreign key that relates to its own table. Every field in the table may contain the special type null.

## From conceptual schema to relational

1. Add an artificial primary key to any collection which needs one.
	1. People use unique identifiers, but i suggest you to add your own.
2. translate associations and inclusions into foreign keys
3. translate multivalued attrivutes into tables
4. flatten complex attributes

How it works?
*One-to-many*
If the association is one in at least one direction (1-N), then choose the unary direction and represent that as a primary key.
I take the unary arrow doesn't change, the other one disappears.

*Many to many.*
Understand that every instance is just a pair.
Every many to many produces a new table.
It can be very long, but just two columns with the two foreign keys.
It is symmetrical.

If you had an association with attributes.


How do I group all employees of the same group? Scan, because tables are not sorted.

## Relationship with attributes

*Subclasses*
The arrow becomes a foreign key.

How do we represent this with a relational schema?
A foreign key into persons.
Each family lives in exactly one flat.
The relationship between land owners (tax-payer) and flats is many to many hence it generates a new table.

> exercise. try both conceptual and logical schema.

### Exercise Medical Center

The management of a medical center wants to manage the center appointments and visits. Many doctors visit in the center. 
For any *appointment*, they want to record the doctor, the patient, date, start and and time, and the reason for the appointment. If the appointment is a follow-up visit after a previous visit, they want to record which was the previous visit. 
For any *visit* they want to know the appointment, the actual starting and ending time, and the diseases that have been diagnosed during the visit and the drugs that have been prescribed. 
For each *drug* we record the active ingredients and the commercial name. 
For each *patient* we record name, address, and those drugs which the patient is allergic to. 
For each *doctor* we record name, address and specialization. 
Prepare a graphical conceptual schema, listing the attributes of each class (in the schema or separately). Try and translate the schema into a graphical relational schema.

It is a subclass if you have at least two extra attribute. 
If there is only one attribute, then the association is sufficient.
If there are two different associations between two classes, you must give a name to at least one of them.

The foreign key should have the same name to the primary key it refers to, unless there are reasons for using a different name. For example, for the previous visit is better to use the name `IsFollowUp`.

Do not call of the id simply id, but use class_id.
This is relevant for simpler queries.

If the patient has a fiscal code, should we keep the patient_id or use the fiscal code? Both solutions are correct, but it is better to use the id. It is a terrible idea to update the primary key and if the fiscal code was typed wrong we should be able to change it. "your stupid system doesn't allow for changing the fiscal code". Then we can add the constraint `unique` to fiscal code.

Can an attribute be at the same time a primary key and a foreign key? Yes, when there is a one to one association.
