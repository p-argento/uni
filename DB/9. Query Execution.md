Since we do not expect users to write their queries in a way that suggests the best strategy for ﬁnding the answer, it is responsibility of the *Query Manager* module of the system to ﬁgure out how to ﬁnd the most efﬁcient way to get the data the user wants.

Query Processing
1. syntactically and semantically correctness
2. transformation into a relational algebra query
3. logical transformation to standardize and simplify the query
4. select a strategy and the algorithms to perform the operations

The result of this process is the *physical query plan*: a tree of physical operators that implement algorithms to execute the relational algebra operators.

Each relational algebra operator can be implemented using several algorithms (physical operators).

For example, the join can be implemented using:
1. nested loops
2. page nested loops
3. index nested loops
