A couple of weeks about normalization.
Then a couple of weeks about internals.

This is mostly about math.
And theorems are important (no proof).

> Just the correct definition

Why study normalization? To avoid redundancy that ruins the quality of the data.

## Functional Dependencies
We want an algorithm to design a good schema from an horrible schema.
What does it mean for a schema to be good?
How can we see if they are equivalents?
We use *functional dependencies*.
It distinguish valid instances from invalid instances.
It means that it is not possible to have two lines that coincide on x and not on y.


$\subseteq$

## Clause Manipulation
$$True\wedge A \wedge B\implies False \vee C \vee D$$
And you can move variables from right to left and viceversa by negating it.

This allows to manipulate sentences in order to obtain functional dependencies.

## Logical Implication
Simple definition
...

It can be computed using the set of 3 inference rules. Called Armstrong 


## Deduction
What is the difference?


## Closures
