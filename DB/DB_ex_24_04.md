Consider the following relational scheme (the set of functional dependencies constitutes a canonical cover): 

R< ABCDE, { AB->C, AC->B, AB->D, D->A, E->B } > 

1. Find at least one key 
2. Knowing that the set of prime attributes is { A,D, E }, check which normal forms are respected by the schema 
3. Apply the synthesis algorithm 
4. Apply the analysis algorithm and tell if the dependencies have been preserved

Consider the following schema, that describes screening of movies, where Time is something like “18:15”, that is, it does not include the date. Any cinema has many different screens; a “screening” is the act of projecting a movie on a screen of a cinema at a given time of a certain date. 

Screenings(MovieId, MovieTitle, Director, Town, CinemaCode, CinemaName, ScreenCode, ScreenName, Date, Time, TicketPrice) 

Translate the following sentences into functional dependencies 

a. No cinema (identified by the CinemaCode) projects two different movies of the same director in the same day 
b. It is not possible that two cinemas in the same town use the same “screenname” for one of their screens 
c. Any two different screening in the same day and in the same cinema start at a different time 
d. All the cinemas that project the same movie in the same town and in the same day have the same TicketPrice 
e. If two different movies projected in the same day have the same title then they have a different director
