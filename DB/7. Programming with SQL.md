there are two alternatives  
1. integrated language into SQL  
2. use of SQL through APIs in a conventional language


## Comparison

PL/SQL is a special language. Not as common as python, for which we can find many libraries. You will not need to train employees on other languages.

The main advantage of PL/SQL is that it will check for error in both parts, because the compiler knows the schema and understands the code.

With the API approach, for the Python compiler, the query is just a string. And then cannot help with incorrect sql syntax or queries.

But now that compilers are really fast, you can just compile&run to see if there are any problems.
