The management of a medical center wants to manage the center appointments and visits. Many doctors visit in the center. 
For any *appointment*, they want to record the doctor, the patient, date, start and and time, and the reason for the appointment. If the appointment is a follow-up visit after a previous visit, they want to record which was the previous visit. 
For any *visit* they want to know the appointment, the actual starting and ending time, and the diseases that have been diagnosed during the visit and the drugs that have been prescribed. 
For each *drug* we record the active ingredients and the commercial name. 
For each *patient* we record name, address, and those drugs which the patient is allergic to. 
For each *doctor* we record name, address and specialization. 
Prepare a graphical conceptual schema, listing the attributes of each class (in the schema or separately). Try and translate the schema into a graphical relational schema.
