This is about the third part
1. permanent memory manager, buffer manager and storage structures
2. query optimizer and access plan manager
3. transaction management and concurrency manager <--

*Undo, redo: which one for durability and which one for atomicity?*

The log is used to store the data and protect the client from errors.

If there is a transactional failure, what would you use Undo or Redo?
Just Undo in the log associated with the transaction, because if fails, you do not need to redo nothing. It is in the buffer, not on the disk.
It is a rollback, an abortion.
Undoing a transaction means undoing all of its operations.

On the other hand, the Redo is for the system failure.
The system must restart. That is about system crash.
There are 3 operations
1. redo list and undo list
2. execute the ??
3. execute the redo list going forward

And for a disaster?
You need to go back to the last db backup.

The backup is usually done with no running transactions (cold backup). It mean that we can skip the undo phase, and do just the redo phase. Otherwise, the transactions without the commit must be undone.

Everything always happen in the buffer.
Working on the buffer allows to restart much faster.


## Protocols
The protocol described is the standard.
But some systems avoid the redo and undo by constraining the buffer.
*NoUndo-Redo Protocol*
If you pin every transaction that you modify, this is a NoUndo situation because there is no need to undo anything. The ones that are not pinned cannot go out of the buffer.
(in the undeo-redo, you unpin immediatly to flush the page and free the buffer)
It is the NoSteal (or Pin) Policy, based on pinning every buffer until commit.
When there is a restart there is no need to undo anything since the failure does not go into the disk.

The problem is that no transaction cannot modify more than the pages than the buffer memory can contain. It is just a problem in theory, because in practice you just 

It has a big size issue, because once you have pinned everything.
But what we want is to have something like "There is no such thing as data is too big".
That's why this approach is not used.

*NoRedo Protocol*
Called Force Policy, where flushing of buffers is forced before commit.
I am giving the buffer manager more space.
Here we have a time problem.

Faster restart of system failure, but at the cost of slower runtime with many ...

This may be used. Why?

*Undo-Redo*
Most dbms prefers this one.
Steal:
NoForce: the buffer manager is not forced to...


When you adopt a NoUndo you differ updates until after the commit, while on Undo you can do update.
"Write ahed log rule" means that you must first write the log and then you can unpin the buffer. Why? Otherwise you may lose the buffer. First flush the log then the buffer.
Some systems flush only the log on a specific disk.





# Concurrency control

Consider 2 ATMs running in parallel.
If two transactions read at the same time and update at the same time, then I will loose the first update.

Types of executions
1. serial execution
	1. all the operations of t1 comes first
	2. but it is impractical
2. interleaved execution

Why serial is impractical?
You need parallelism. Even in a physical bank there are people serving clients in parallel. How to avoid overdraft?
We want an effect that is the one of serial execution, but with a concurrent execution.
I need a manager that keeps track of all the executions.

## Strict 2PL Protocol

The Lock Protocol is exclusive. If i want to go the bathroom, I have the key and no one else can.
In CS, read and write are conflicting, and cannot be done at the same time.

Serialized ability comes after...



If you know that you will update, you need to use:
`SELECT FOR UPDATE`
