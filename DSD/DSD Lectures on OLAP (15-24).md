OLAP refers to the technique of performing complex business  multidimensional analysis over the data warehouse.

In JRS, Options > Show Logical Plan.

Query 1.
Number of distinct customers by product.
```SQL
SELECT FkProduct, COUNT(DISTINCT(FkCustomer)) AS NCustomers
FROM Invoices, InvoiceLines
WHERE FkInvoiceNo=PkInvoiceNo
GROUP BY FkProduct;
```

Query 2.
Largest invoice revenue by product.
(for every product,  we want to know the total revenue of the invoice containing that product with the highest)

```SQL
WITH TotalByInvoice AS
	(SELECT FkInvoiceNo AS Invoice, SUM(FkProduct * Qty) AS TotalInvoice
	FROM InvoiceLines
	GROUP BY FkInvoiceNo)

SELECT FkProduct, MAX(TotalInvoice)
FROM InvoiceLines, TotalByInvoice
WHERE FkInvoiceNo=Invoice
GROUP BY FkProduct;
```

Query 3.
The percentage of revenue generated by the product over the total revenue of the customer by Customer and Product.

```SQL
WITH
a AS
	(
	SELECT FkCustomer, FkProduct, SUM(Price* Qty) AS Revenue
	FROM InvoiceLines, Invoices
	WHERE FkInvoiceNo=PkInvoiceNo
	GROUP BY FkCustomer, FkProduct
	),
b AS
	(
	SELECT FkCustomer, SUM(Price* Qty) AS Revenue
	FROM InvoiceLines, Invoices
	WHERE FkInvoiceNo=PkInvoiceNo
	GROUP BY FkCustomer
	)

SELECT a.FkCustomer, FkProduct,
	100*a.Revenue / b.Revenue AS pct
FROM a,b
WHERE a.FkCustomer=b.FkCustomer;
```

This is a very complicated version of the query that can be simplified using the extended SQL that we see today.

A DW is all about getting answers to business questions, in the form of reports. Reports must communicate pertinent information clearly and concisely.

Visual Reporting Tools (no sql required)
1. Excel Pivot tables
2. PowerPivot
3. Microstrategy
4. QlinkView
5. ...

OLAP refers to the technique of performing complex business analysis over the interaction ..

Many solutions
1.  DOLAP
	1. The OLAP Client may connect to a server with multidimensional
	2. It builds a local representation (Desktop OLAP or DOLAP), which is feasible only for small data, typically single users.
2. RDBMS
	1. The software queries the data using SQL
	2. Cuboids may be already available, if not, there is a sql query to RDBMS
	3. If cuboids exists
		1. MOLAP, using MDX
		2. do not scale with very big because the cube would be too large
	4. if cuboids do not exiists
		1. ROLAP, using SQL
		2. there are ways to speed up calculations, precomputing some cuboids that are stored in the relational db (called materialized views)
	5. hybrid solution
		1. HOLAP

Third Solution.
Like Microstrategy.
We write manually SQL Queries on the relational db.
