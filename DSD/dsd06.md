## The relational data model

Definition.
1. int, floats, bool and strings are primitive types
2. (A1: T1, ..., An: Tn) is a tuple type of degree n
	1. where T1,...,Tn are primitive types and A1,...,An are distinct attributes names;
	2. attribute order is NOT important
3. (A1 := V1, ..., An := Vn) of type T = (A1: T1, ..., An:Tn) is a set of pairs (Ai, Vi) with Vi of primitive type Ti


Definition.
A relational database is described by a set of relation schemes R:{T} defined as
1. T =


Definition.
Consider a relation scheme R:{T}
1. a schema instance (or relation) is a finite set of tuples with type T


> Since the relations are sets of tuples, they do not have duplicates
