## 6 - Individual Mobility laws and models
(aka individual models)
maybe call it mobility laws
> 1. distances (travel distance, radius of gyration,...)
> 2. predictability (entropy,...)

"while computer scientists are interested in making algorithms; network scientist are more interested in extrapolating universal laws in human mobility"







## 7 - Human Mobility Model
(aka mobility models)
>1. Modelling individual Human Mobility
	1. EPR
>2. Collective Models
	1. definition of Spatial Flows
	2. Gravity Model (G)
	3. Intervening Opportunities (IO)
	4. Radiation Model (modified IO)
	5. Other collective models (Deep gravity)
>3. Input data
	1. 


[ERP](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys1760#Fig2)



## 8 - Mobility Patterns
(aka mobility patterns)
> 1. Global patterns: clustering
>2. Local Patterns

Trajectory Clustering (ie. global trajectory patterns)
1. Trajectory distances
	1. single-point approaches (reduce trajectory to single-points )
	2. hausdorff distance (trajectory as set of points)
	3. frechet distance (trajectory as sequence of points)
	4. ED, DTW (time-series distances)
	5. avg ED (trajectory as time-stamped sequence of points)
2. Trajectory clustering algorithms (density-based)

Trajectory frequent pattern (ie. local trajectory patterns)
3. Flocks, Convoys & Swarms 
4. Moving clusters  
5. T-Patterns

Quick peek into Deep Learning
6. DETECT algorithm



## 9 - Location Prediction
(aka location prediction)
> 1. Mobility prediction: a taxonomy
> 2. Next location prediction
