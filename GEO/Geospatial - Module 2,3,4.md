## 6 - Individual Mobility laws and models
(aka individual models)
> 1. distances (travel distance, radius of gyration,...)
> 2. predictability (entropy,...)

"while computer scientists are interested in making algorithms; network scientist are more interested in extrapolating universal laws in human mobility"

	3. Intervening Opportunities
	4. Deep gravity
	5. Other models

## 8 - Mobility Patterns
(aka mobility patterns)
> 1. Global patterns: clustering
>2. Local Patterns

## 9 - Location Prediction
(aka location prediction)
