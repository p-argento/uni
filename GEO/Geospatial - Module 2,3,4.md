## 6 - Individual Mobility laws and models
(aka individual models)
maybe call it mobility laws
> 1. distances (travel distance, radius of gyration,...)
> 2. predictability (entropy,...)

"while computer scientists are interested in making algorithms; network scientist are more interested in extrapolating universal laws in human mobility"







## 7 - Human Mobility Model
(aka mobility models)
>1. Modelling individual Human Mobility
	1. EPR
>2. Collective Models
	1. definition of Spatial Flows
	2. Gravity Model (G)
	3. Intervening Opportunities (IO)
	4. Radiation Model (modified IO)
	5. Other collective models (Deep gravity)
>3. Input data
	1. 


[ERP](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys1760#Fig2)



## 8 - Mobility Patterns
(aka mobility patterns)
> 1. Global patterns: clustering
>2. Local Patterns

## 9 - Location Prediction
(aka location prediction)
> 1. Mobility prediction: a taxonomy
> 2. Next location prediction
