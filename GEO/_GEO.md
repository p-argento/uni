## Introduction
Mobility data and spatial phenomena.

*People*
Riccardo di clemente (guest lecture).
BarabÃ si (book).
Greg Milner (book on gps).

The evolution of science is made by tools, like the microscope or phones.
Higher dimensional data are more sensitive to privacy.

## GIS

Fundamentals concpets
1. Geographic coordinate system
	1. to locate points on Earth
2. Vector data model
	1. representation of spatial features
3. Trajectory
	1. sequence of points
4. Spatial tessellation
	1. division of space in non-overlapping tiles
5. Flows
	1. movements of people
	2. COMPARING WITH TRAJECTORY, the trajectory is a single 

Geographic Coordinate System (GCS).
Be aware of the order used by the library.
Is it (lat,long) or (long, lat)?


## Code fundamentals
See the github.

Main libraries
1. shapely
2. geopandas
3. scikit-mobility

> You might encounter problems of compatibility. Try to use the yml file on github.

## Spatial Data Analysis

Try QGIS software, it is opensource.
